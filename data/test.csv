72,0,the the popular actor or musician wash the tree teach and because it it it talk us how to action i 'll talk at how to fight then children may follow them and they will pro rea i think this person kind can be follow because from his uh who uh
73,0,the woman expresses uh on which a who looks be rest he opinion about the university plan was consu want about a small size of a screen and uh um uh is his planes reasons uh he uh called uh that she thought that um uh it uh was to uh little latest uh to read and uh it 's not uh it was n't it lots of more th actually um he he actually and that she in the other shade they did n't like it it would be better to rate from uh the total pages and um
74,0,the person are the most the right commu to uh i 'd like an is this the artist can for the problems to the per student in is and i do n't like uh pressure profession uh fall their care action should tell it can she it gets to there are to swar france and i let 's better and the second reason i less but teen her man is because first the start of reading it walk start is true uh parents
75,0,the problem is her her cousin 's retire to my retire retirement party is exact same time with her class so uh uh in this conversation uh they they give me uh the to to um to state two month to solve it one is uh she she she she teach the class and uh let that um retired retirement party and the other one is uh the female english professor is um cage the class instead of all uh the female english professor
76,0,there are in my opinion size agree about the parents should not be should be involved in the process of helping po there are while their children 's choosing univers because that happened to me and they 've because of their influences i had to uh choose uh some it be think some they narrow uh topics uh actually so it limits the
77,0,according to the lecture lot he and according to the lecturer he sets the some intelligent ants chain him some intelligence ants can take a wide they all the stay go in in the ant any their ants parts in the parts and they and that they can go go on the pa prefers car he ha

79,0,uh point now i agreeing this uh statement uh parents should be help they help uh their children to choose the university because that uh when the children to choose their university she is uh that she 's work uh she is uh there is children are just when just to be uh class to to be a i i 'd that and they did not enters there and uh the university wo uh will will help them will help them and the way university is a con uh perform him come from them so parents should help children to choose a good university
80,0,how all problem is that i she make party were not with the part or not do n't make the man messed to suggest suggestion their first is to talk uh first is to uh take uh uh uh is to be up centers class as sent class absent all class or or keep s keep to wing it class so to uh keep teaching and if the class so uh the second is to he teaching
81,0,according to the it 's an lecture there and made the colony and move together to get the therefore um the concept of warmer intelligent his bulb together and state city there and the uh urn moving the trees to get the the food uh they use wi wide space so to cross with so it so this is a problem and should be cere dig so they should stay on the first the first and do audi to read the food so so they get who would

83,0,in my purse but the the others are very when the idea that parents should be involve in the process of helping their children to choose a university first reason sto children can be if parents should environme the in the helping their children to choose university children can uh can me not independently children should choice their in their future and children should have no that parents cannot be always with them the children must be no that

88,0,well the reading passage is about real feet and to purse wait and it gave last example like cau a product that uh in name fun the disadvantages of the product but he will give more advantage things to cover the does of language meant and in and uh research in the lady reports the professor gives us uh example about span and s and ca n't pen pants and hands and he said that uh uh woman but uh pants and hands that is explain sells uh spend more money to buy other passed and pants but uh you can see the long tire n' benefit from at but to like the company to big you 'll along in time protection

100,1,the talk but this some products that they are they could in comes for the somethings stay healthy they have the do two ways for her that to best things that the first one that 's a bus they containers is using of the usually for customers that they like a s such as when they have is about the plastics for the some kind of that was a bus they some covers of the glasses but now the use of the flexible practice that is the over of them they can uh we can s every movie it 's so easily and do it uh this so pleasure for to customers another way for the it 's that is about the take the cookies of the some campus that they will have ass these these cookies rebuild the on the of can say carry walks or maybe sometimes with the with producers on the guest educations that will be so pleasures and soul nice they things for the customers that the like the the like it to have it in a we can say productions production increase containers is s maybe the customers likes to have it likes to have their goods on that
101,1,the man is not really happy about the pro uh uh proposals given in the letter because uh he thinks the pur proposals or not importance this this this because now these you can see everything on the wet and you can get all the informations in the web and no need to get go to the meetings in all those things it uh for the meetings you cool at the end of the tree and you know that he does not help to so if if you go to the web few can call any time you like a new june also he also says that it was uh sometimes written also and what has happened and all does and and he 's uh he does n't uh his opinion is that she 'd uh does n't agree with the proposal in the letter and he also s has says that uh in the web does does every things giving terry clearly and you can you know cool and feet web
102,1,the rap had the so like uh the other wish uh it 's self the it is take than uh environment from the tree they host a be because they host tree maybe they do n't uh used to sunlight but they have so they call reaction to the uh the just her uh the letter so now the tree to a self uh they always just uh thirty or forty cry uh they have uh storm leaves to lecture they can test tree strongly so thus they will uh called what 's the tree
103,1,one way products can appeal to consumers but as the parent just good like it if in both like f both when the case of their stalk that it is it now was about cookies if it 's it will be little come ball books when looking at it 's people be attractive would willing to buy it was when the seeds in the classy math so this with the printed books not mode and woods use my by it did much easier to use were by like in case of the ketchup or mustard he said that i would put in a glass wants not is out but after that it will have a good be when ninth plastic bottles firstly therefore people to them band then the well the press it 's uh ketchup almost thirty miles he still use size students in the last one th they two examples i mean appealing to the consumers bird by good books its container inc you buy it
104,1,um the book that i never s read and and i i want to read now is about the about the poetry there are several reasons to support people it one is that um poetry quietly let me create uh great thing in a new and in the way the way uh even ball reading or my house become ins quiet um the second reason is that uh allow the poetry book let me think and um um create something beautiful and give me um get willing in my heart
105,1,well the man and say that he stated to um bring to guitar uh in the new band so he will uh free will have a concert it uh and to ask uh ask acts her to uh sees concert that uh she had she have no time at tech concert so i think uh she would she will uh is come to the concert uh on the net and as a day of they uh which is that uh
106,1,well uh in this task as a professor and they passage uh they are use that uh if fish they has uh how how they be these have adapted to life in the rainforest uh the professor uh shows uh several examp all to help last try this the first uh if he tells uh had a unique shape uh to store water uh the uh when uh joy in the rain forest in the rain forest uh the for rea form the was um
107,1,in the rain friend we have a problem with uh small plants uh school plants in the ground because uh in the top of the try and trees have high branches who which created uh a very important protections um um small plants have uh quite a line to group and we have some plants which are really well ad update uh about this problem for example hm uh and if he fit uh have and take to life in the rain friends because they store water um we have the campus some nutrients which are to come posed um the store water
108,1,i prefer to have there 's a problem or mobile phone with them at all times there are two reasons to bring that first of all the cell phone is a s a show in more do n't life because if you are a businessman you should contact with your then you are clients and then another reason is the urgent cut urgent condition uh if you are mart if your parents contact me i need my cell plan to bring the uh brea as
109,1,the man disagrees the letter which says the school should eliminated the men the to a meeting with the academic advisor first he says you you can get extra information from the advisor is different from the basic information which is on the internet you can find many different way to meet the requirement the like it take different class and he had n't never prop he never had the problems to skip problems with the scheduling the meeting if you cool col to the advisor early enough you have no problem to schedule the meeting only when new wait until the last few days you have a problem just so if you prepare early they will be no problem in scheduling
110,1,in the lecture or the man is studying the and and also playing a guitar in the band they will have a show neg in the next uh couple wakes but to they have problems about uh it the campus was uh borrow by other persons so this they think two solutions first they can play in the wednesday night but uh it has some under problems to for example there are uh they will being smaller audience for the um and uh many people will have do their works in middle in the middle of the wake second they think that they could can send other people to perform with hm in the next saturday it will having but they think that it would n't have enough time to preparing what they have prepared
111,1,here the discussion is mainly about the man uh in the student loans music with his friends and is it to play it in the campus auditorium so the problem here is that the campus auditorium is already book for several uh fi film months and there was only one solution is that they are low tools in the next wasted like together stea but the but the problem is that there will be small uh there will be less audience available in the ten but there are another solution is that next common saturday they can play with with combining with the others who are playing the music in the campus auditorium in my solution they could play on the next very state it 's smaller audience as the audience conc the talk about uh about the play of the music
112,1,i like to book it 's card harry potter harry potter is a magic story and the he has uh appealing uh stories and we can and every story have a happy ending the evil well died in the and show we like to have a potter passed and then um mainly students have uh magic uh like harry potter i
113,1,in the lecture the professor to as the actually the consumer when they are buying in many buy things they not just buyed uh the things but also the container of the product and um he and uh she elaborated that this comes that uh from this uh ch expect uh first is uh to let the uh co to let the container became for use uh that 's uh that 's to say the consumer can buyed it the home uh when when they buy it uh uh home uh they can use it in many ways a like um uh putting food on it or and and so wants and second is to uh let the uh a container to have uh pleasing appearance and some uh uh some again ord uh some consumers may uh because of these uh reason talk to leave a bring the a product at homes and uh that 's why te uh uh some of compli buy cookies at um often is make the uh the nice mental box of cookies
114,1,i would like to read the book of some at guest biography of one of the historical person of in the end history ex book contains a lot many general knowledge is things like related to business the letter to public dealing related to the duty of one person or we can say any of the people at the reading status of life regarding child who either to after the matter is at the or it is it is so this book regards many of the information and which is beneficial for uh stu learn not many
115,1,is a business class and uh professor talking about the uh did it is important great there design to get uh has some products they they sh see waits are two example one if the uh user friendly and another one is the attractive attractive fu design an containers the first one is the for example plastic container and glass container is it 's difference see explain um plastic container is the build inc and convenient than glass container and the second um she talking about uh cookies boxes for example is the it 's very should be attractive pictures
116,1,the product the pro uh the products a container is the should be used two way to design appear the to con consumers one way re the be friendly in the it can make to um consumers feel very comfortable and uh all peoples won the time the people to get touch with them uh it can uh attract more people to use their use their products and then the an another way is the um have a good carry page because uh every everyone want built for things in and uh if they uh if they look the qua the good her paid a and they me attract attractive from the products it can may sk them to buy them it 's very useful on in the um everyone wants uh beautiful things
117,1,well few plants can grow on the shady ground alone and many plant many plants have adapted to learn to adapted to live in the rain forest for example the urn plant the urn plant i around uh or is always around the tree sh trunks and use a tree to support themselves and uh if they are on the tree they can get plenty of some likes and uh uh uh it 's head it can store water and water is so important to it plant you now um when the water will be down d ample uh down to bowl of the base um and the other nutrie nutrients oh also land on the leaves and washed down to the to the to the to the urn plant urn plants and what is why is s very imp important so and they in their buys have adapted to
118,1,well they uh epiphytes have uh adapted to life in rain forest by attaching uh their roots to the branch of the tree and this could make make them uh to uh the tree can support support them support the plant and to get a plenty of sunlight also um they can uh absorb water thus store um uh and the water contains nutrients um the flower in the top why will uh store nutrients and water ste and then rose down to the uh today rude so this plan ca n't may use of them and another way is uh should through the water stored and only requirement the water supplied uh as a fertilizer
119,1,uh if the how uh there are all of book that i have not read but it is very it 's since interesting in reading because of uh two reason this book is planting tree in that uh there are two following reasons first firstly uh it has uh very uh special main title uh i 've never heart about the planting in planting tree in does n't it 's ins fair interesting and secondly it might be encourage my increase me to uh tries to try something and tell him she to uh very sim
120,1,i prefer taking my cell phone ways me at all times because um uh one of the lead an it 's that we can um no the time from their one uh uh uh but the main reason is um i can contact with my friends a do n't um we mails each other in crowded treat so we can meet again is uh we can meet each other again easily
121,1,uh the p uh the opinion uh the proposal in the letter it 's about the two toy your time and then the man suggested not everyone need to meet ad advisor uh ind regular basis hm then the hm uh was that man um and the man did n't think it the same thing as they uh busy to website and get information out stay pay a cost
122,1,i prefer to have mobile phone with my s with we will me uh all the times uh the reasons are following aspects first of all i think there are so many people we whom i it like to i 'd like to uh touch with uh they are if there is some uh some somethings that they want to tell me they can uh they can use the mobile phone to uh talk to me uh as soon as possible and uh the second reason is that uh i can get a lot of information through the cell phone um based down the statement however i prefer that
123,1,i pretty want to read the book is the lord of the rain uh i think do story is uh is a very band they good is a very s brand the book because the also have um very good imaginary and uh story is talk about the war uh it 's also attract me uh also the character the man internet uh is very brave and uh it can motive aid encourage my encourage my imaginary and uh hm makes me because uh with the author and uh we i can learn moon much thing according the correct
124,1,there is one of the book named the life that my friends told me but i have n't read uh so but i heard this book is very me meaningful so at first or the my friend told me after reading this book the book can gave her uh advisor give actions to make choice in every life aspects so it 's very meaningful to ask to make tries at the and the next reason it 's can keep ported to added to used to life so that is my friend told me to um after reading this book i i s store her words uh be be more positive in mo shiny and extra bo person so uh a task this
125,1,according to to the lecture the professor talks about a how to product 's container appealing to consumers as the first way in the past products always give the flexible provides and flexible um sensible cha charge of the goods can chat uh can chatting uh consumers because flexible is over food it 's much fast easier to attract the ca n't consumers and the second way is appealing have parents because are not because if there is a nice metal box in a beautiful in a bill to go appear appearance it will looks nice and and make people the lines so that would in incentive consumer to buy it so that is uh two way of the product container um of the uh to appealing of the uh appealing consumers that 's my answer thank you
126,1,well the man is uh take about in the male discuss then ke uh under other play the guitar id guitar in um little bank and want to have a concert uh uh in a couple of the weeks but uh he has a pr of them that uh when they want to um one to appro pro on per po perform in the enough store away back to a new problems there but is out of of fall books and uh and uh how to find and uh how to find uh the time in the uh in the roman roman time and he find defined uh it it will be open in next uh saturday per ano another band occur one to played playing in that time uh um click agree uh he wa dig expand uh his band played uh a while and the other and the rest get the rest lesser time and the letters the time the and the other band occur performance and uh
127,1,well according to notice that be fi the kind of one time press either and the professor uh um hold uh example uh the old one plan um there are most uh significantly any even if he can he the ev humans uh for the world plan the water and the neutral and uh the urn plant um and use uh the parasite is with it became a part of the plant uh find a support of from the whole cost uh and uh hm climb the true the to the hired a plays to and know more more sun um stage least although less daughter more water by the prince a principle greater then the with the with the shape of for uh con ca n't hm ca n't um and the bowl uh bowl of that uh this the far or in the century and and uh rain when water cool through the school in the leaf and uh they get the usual future nice of from the water
128,1,uh well the man uh disag grade uh uh counseling uh the in the back uh advisor uh meeting um and because he said uh going the uh white that uh uh website uh on the internet uh at the school uh site is um all about uh all arm the i'm is uh the are uh basic this information and uh which uh which are not very uh um because people old know about them and they they want know uh the professors and uh the advisors uh advice uh and uh to make choices and uh also the counselor and con con comes uh ca cancel the meeting and they do n't have time and to uh meet
129,1,a student write a letter to the newspaper about to can so and the requirement is not to use for the advisor meeting and uh the man think the we we do you need the advisor meeting firstly he think the hm we cannot so small more eat hel information in the website another advisor can give different opinion and details about the course and class hm ex give some eq special and the sick significant eq special uh suggestion and secondly he think the meeting time is okay he can he can find some space sp a times spared sp a time to to meet the advisor and he also think if he without the advisors suggestion it is and hard and take a long time for he to make a schedule and uh so he keep her opinion
130,1,in the conversation the boy has got a problem that he and his band and uh has uh did n't decide uh went to have the show uh and the first solution uh and the first solution is that the girl introduce uh him to uh have some prop s appro prof performs before his uh show um and the second solution is uh to transfer the show in the middle of the weekend so they have uh another fun for the old audito s and in my s opini i think it 's better to have a show perform before their concert so they should uh transfer the show into next uh to
131,1,the book then i have not read but are interesting in reading is held tour series i can pref i i have s tear not the really with the popular book yet but there are two reasons why i'm interest in the books firstly it 's a popular and it is i haves what 's the mole be of the harry personally s and eat attracts the miss so much the stories and the characters so attractive and i want to read the books o and the second reason is that i really like the books were the stories now earlier so like fun does number is such as are are goal are the books that i love so much for this reasons i want to read harry porter series
132,1,epiphytes have adapted in the life in the rain forest from uh is uh it use uh uh the plants use a host plants to growth uh the that means he must uh that that means the plants must uh have another treat uh to be a host of of these plants uh epiphytes usually live appo the tree or i think the top of the tree because uh the plants must absorb a lot of sunlight that 's what it used to get if he if it lives in the upper of the tree well from the holes uh tree to uh is it can support he can support a nutrients he can take uh a lot of nutrients from out there and the nutrients can produce from the dead but if insects insects or live from the other tree and it decompose
133,1,hm i think it is the really come they created a question that had to answered might be depend down the s city was you are view in public place uh uh own a cell phone and uh make a call will interrupt or the peoples wrong you and if you are and the cell phone also make you can also rate with people uh uh listen music and uh certain intern night so that uh question mad be announces by a cause like is business
134,1,the le lecture is about um container uh when uh when people buy product they buy container to therefore it is important to imp important the design of the container uh container should be friendly and convenient for consumers uh to buy i was first uh first he worries of plastic container and he developed would glass container and finally um uh be uh he get to flexi the mo flexible container which can uh rocks create ketchup uh appealing appearance is also very important source beg for example when by a cookie uh con uh consumers see nice metal box is more better because eat looks the nice and decorate by it looking more attractive
135,1,uh the man 's problem is that they he has started a parent and so and he will make here open a concert but t concert au auditorium room is book on to the next weekends and by this pro from the man and woman discuss two possible solutions the first solution is that they could perform with it of the week and the second option is to she that they could perform with the another band i think the first option is better for the man because things he made the band and it is the first concert they perf they ope uh so they need diff so they need to perform or the songs they have practiced these reason the man 's should perform with other day
136,1,d pa uh did n't think that it 's of the to meet d d that uh they cares before every semester because internet and you are able to find a think that the information from dirt from the teacher and with that the internet and find guys that the and uh he has invention that he has d d problems with meeting teach this d and and that 's why in the internet it 's more much more had and it
137,1,the proposal was talking about that uh people should meet the their advisors and uh uh uh taking time ant uh consult feed them before register it 's semester and the art or was not uh uh uh um was not i i agreed with this because uh uh she or he thought that uh it uh it 's uh time i waste wasting time and all information is in the website and uh the man was a dense this opinion because he thought that advisors no men extract things that can help so student for example different ways uh to uh finishing education different kind of courses and classes and choices and the schedule uh or not if you set uh set a time uh early and if you to it to the and of the time it will be a little
138,1,harry potter is a book that i have not read but are interested in reading i have seeing harry potter 's fill and it s o prof perfect um harry potter sign magic story i think he tells us to tells us about uh a boy who against to the bad got they it 's care it uh tv teaches um me about come insist
139,1,uh in uh listening material we can get the information that the man uh are not disagree and uh he easy he think st um uh it 's is uh uh is a uh u some basic informations are website has it cannot have us um if you want to choose class you can you make and make it uh on the website ap to if you want talkers somewhat it will figure out unders if someone in trouble um he uh you 'll is they will wait for some minutes to deal with his there are trouble so i think the man s the le opini uh is right
140,1,well the reading is faster making it uh the letter of student and cold uh name advisor meeting should no longer be required uh the uh the listening is a discussion between to student in the reading the letter it 's uh is stated that the student stated that uh uh we uh the advisor meeting should no longer be requi since uh the information are available website in uh it 's hard uh uh for student to fine and to schedule time and more of a uh uh he think that students should uh do n't have to uh by it 's traffi uh in the reading the mainte do n't agree uh does n't agree with uh the letter uh for now some reasons uh for for some following reasons firstly he thing also basic information are uh on the web uh advisors the uh can uh oriented and cousin 's uh to have different classes and help us a high and have students with extra information moral time is not a problem since it 's student school only they can
141,1,i think uh they adapted like this save their hike thirty or even forty meters and so they have plenty of sunlight uh and they um their branches are around the tree so they have it support uh gives her slightly over flapping so it 's good for to porter the it it it it
142,1,some people prefer not to bring their cell phone with them everywhere they go however i prefer to take mobile phone every time because it is convenient firstly uh mobile phone allows us to contact with others when when needed hm uh the second reason uh the second reason that the ph mobile phone is con opinion is that it has a lot of other functions such as calculator and notes uh these since why i want to bring the cell phone or mobile phone with me at every time
143,1,i'm interested in reading reading a book uh i choose swan of the book is family of for a teenager are it 's called twilight bec actually i bought this bul when i can to see other the first time so uh but i heard uh it is real it lees good for it is really good for improving my english skills so that 's why i choose i am interested in this book but i have to finish reading yet so i'm going to finish certain readings than s s a that 's high i'm interesting this per
144,1,in this set of the materials uh reading passes describe how to survive how to survive uh it piece of tease is and the reading passage describe urn plant um the in the in the listening passage urn plant is survives unique unique uniquely it 's like their shape is like kind of unique uh the so they can store a lot of water and it helps for nutrition such as insects and something like that and uh food so that 's why i uh it pc appea cities is have adapted to life because they can store a lot of water so so that 's why they can survive in rain forest
145,1,these the proposal in the letter have to pass first is about uh due to get good a good with that that advisor about courses and uh although the said that uh the fi fishes uh about which is it 's on line state the classmate always that have companies uh with the uh advisor uh so the boy uh that the about the letter he give he gives two ways first uh unlike does n't have actually church so uh so meeting with uh get the grad is necessary section uh some students just uh just with letter before like but like solve this uh into the con confidence so if the students reads the but that he better in advance there would be a have happy
146,1,first there is a boy signed he do n't uh have so many time to practice i think it again after school and uh after class and the e you free times very can you can have a uh you can with your friend have mall practice and roll right more sun and uh one day you will perfo me and uh second uh he site hey bill uh not have so many chance to perform with his uh how to say play mate and so i want to say uh they have a lot of chance in school for example uh they have a lot of tall and the saying concert and uh a lot of who uh have say party so you will crisis chance to show yourself perform uh one form show and uh make you songs uh like uh like the more people know your sounds harry wall ice uh that 's all
147,1,the book i am interesting in reading is a design book that is publish in my country uh the first reason is that it it will had many pick the rest can view and uh attractive stories that uh they 're that we of their inf fill that me fill very relax and uh secondly i many friend have the same book of it i can share the book waited that were shoul improve our relationship uh other that least uh the s for short story it where ha let me very enjoy need that can uh help with very relaxed from the work and their study
148,1,in the lecture the professor explained the two ways that a product are contained will be and he divide into two groups one one important uh ways contained friendly uh commune in they used to for the p rock the product where attract will for the customer and flexible using well also let it 's a customer to choose this product and the second uh way is uh place appearance this is very important for ford so fantastic or appearance of group of the book well focus so the customer i 'd i will attract them to buy it and uh it 's the well way use forty in sun cookies
149,1,according to the conversation the man the man think the requiring the with with their academic advisors tricks uh by internet intelli proposal is a more a kind of a okay um educate way to uh meet with some advisors because it is ease his way to miss the man um beca uh to be specific if they get in touch with the cell phone by cell phone uh it will be and they will be ways so loan and um they ca n't connect with they uh they wo n't big uh able to connect with this uh so hm by phone
150,1,well still leading and listening how explains about epiph those helps practical well because of the rainfall uh example urn plant girls near trees so that they can get enough sunlight and also in addition the leaves and for was had various shape to help get the water and nutrient so the uh so that abso it 's if this that plant the plant when they need food uh it
151,1,many plants had adapted to life in forest be developing straight teaches for survive or the professor talks about how pur fly a have adapted to life in the rain forest for example urn plant they e use they use tree to suppor uh for a structure of live they they can s it is possible to store water why i overlapping and rolling um using the water supply it is it it it helps them to chemical depose she shop um fall ice in water store
152,1,in the point of will uh having a cell phone is much better uh because is more much more convenient for my relatives and friends to find me and i can be part to their my locations so that 's they will not be worry about me and i thinks there are many functions in a phones such as a food to taking uh hearing the epiph free uh you can use the uh the the locating tools of the this is the cell phone for for uh for location it when you a going to ha i go go for a taking uh so their fi think uh have a cell phone is must use so it specially uh in these modern society uh you have to uh he have to trace the to the web pace of the well
153,1,d d do n't uh do n't uh d d d d d d d d d and is and dull do n't uh d d so does who d d
154,1,in this set of material the professor in the describe that uh two ways that uh products a contains the can be designed to appeal to uh can rumors um one is one is to make a parent products it uh use the possible un uh and there is other one is uh the also one is a give a products completing appeasing is uh um in the first uh in the first uh way in the professor said that uh she can uh he he uh what 's more and uh in the second the way that 's a professor said that people can cooks together and and the and the p ca n't or that more interesting book

156,1,the problem with this th uh the problem with this is the they um the problem here is that uh uh do uh there is no low auditorium there lead to all the auditorium spor filled with the uh filled with uh with the uh activities and uh the solution for this problem is he should be perform that thus uh his performance by use it 's in the talk concept concert by with his friends that um that he uh uh the performances do n't for their provide and other dead a performance was done by with his friends of all light uh this is the best to this is the best solution that i recommend because uh they and because they will be note cha and more the charms of getting because all the weekends of filled with the with the other activities and all those so i prefer this doing with these friends perform in the same with his friends
157,1,in the given listening passage the professor uh talks of explains two ways that a products container can be designed to applaud uh to consumers there are two uh so the first method is to designed it uh user friendly and so that uh consumers can use it conveniently uh the lakes uh it 's the example that he gives is that uh there is a plastic uh container and the other one is uh designed in glass uh when pouring a ketchup uh plastic uh is the store reasonable because it was very flexible so it was more attractive to consumers the second design uh was that was designed they can be displaying in home uh for example uh one is one is designing card provides and one is uh design with bet all box with beautiful uh pictures becau the metal box uh look more ke
158,1,the point the when a band and they would kill a concert in the campus uh the is just to prepare them into we can to pant bulb first uh but the class as the meet of the week will be great for this reasons there uh small audience for them tends enough the courage information from could is live performance after band his his f a much uh test speak so what 's know the uh few time for them to perform their songs they they talk to just to should them if the if the time is limited give to choose their family age uh the most uh most um move to move to to cho to perform cook you audience and uh could passion
159,1,uh the professor also something about the container of products and need to the two examples to impor the containers to learn firstly the container should be friendly which which would be attractive to consumers uh their as be on oh yeah so many uh so many others for pa it and it 's uh containers so important at this thing at this time sir friend an is so important that useful would be would be consider what acted at the consumer would consider it to be another use another use then parties his pour the after this products maybe uh phone for one thing but the container will be fun and it 's a so uh the useful of a container is uh should be consid for the produced
160,1,now i can explain two way that 's a product 's containers can be decided to appeal to customer the first the first uh the pro the product container uh have to convenient to use for example the the ketchup have to just flexible plastic uh it 's better than the cla the glasses the glass the glass container because when dishes a flexible plastic you can just easily and the second one uh the product container have have to have to look nice like uh for example cookie box when the customer see they cookie box they want to s they will see that looks
161,1,book that i have read i uh ch arrest in reading is a new i think it 's uh because like they might be a good book because i have friends then was ap my friend have read that book uh i think it 's very good because uh many people greedy then it be fun that book and i i like to read s s some some hi offset book the type book uh is like the fact see stars escape week uh getting the picture
162,1,the first way that the product con to can be designed to appeal to cons ceremonies to get con uh useful possible like plastic container in the past the like now that is a past after made pass the that a glass then nights flexible much more convenient to use but she fresher them lead and second where uh like if that who duty um container uh the container can decide cookie nice little box appeared food picture so it 's uh they they need to the more classic much more appealing to the consumer
163,1,uh i i interested in reading the book uh for me to uh to uh interested in reading this book uh was uh part can the man is can panels is uh beautiful history uh the revolution um friends in um um and while uh wh uh is plant the ri are uh uh uh in there are
164,1,personally i would like to say that my ever i want to read a friday an a produce and they are too bored reason to name them and the most import thinks that this classic it is so interesting their art everybody want to read it again and again uh uh and uh was small and this classics can improved uh my ability awful uh plant ge reach for example i can pick up more beautiful uh and uh all them take or sentence to express myself abi imitation so uh it 's fun text take uh so th size why my uh i want to read this book
165,1,the end if it is there is a kind of urn plant because is uh is just like them uh supported by tree and highly or high in the tree and the con could store water uh just uh by the other plants and uh it use uh host the plan plan for for survival first wife well and um it has it have no do n't nutrition new new tree d screens uh just uh get it by the others and washed down and be composed in store the water um
166,1,i pre pre so uh some people like to have a cell phone and mobile for an with them other time because uh if they have visit call they have ten story and there are so uh they can play gain with the uh mobile phone den d now uh not and like uh text text methods and they friend so if they take uh cell phone every time every where they can enjoy it or time or so uh they lodge um uh they do n't losing there 're basic col so i think i prefer to day the
167,1,i pre pot is a whole the plant in the lay impressed attach the two uh apart trees to get more sunlight professor explain their prep light by using specific two characteristics first is wish um he live shape easier per is pass the pic like polar and law le and cone shape so lane water is lay water can pour uh observe the in wars shaped uh leaves so they can if water also which they can observe the nutrient of by sunlight and decomposed well will their plant so
168,1,so i prefer to have uh my cell phone uh with me all the time because uh it 's uh it 's often use one for example where there is uh a number reasons you can going to the police are or something ants and uh when you do n't have your cell phone um how fun there you need it so uh and this is a funny is uh made to be in mo be him so a new cannot habit of the time so just have it all the time like prefer this
169,1,this set of materials or the letter to the uh they need uh uh academic advisors for help them uh to know some informations for for the uh for help uh uh it 's helpful for them and and the in a man did did n't agree with that because uh he think that is not helpful for for a students a different a student have to for the classes so they have the different needs forth for that i and the academic advisor uh well not give them some helpful informations and the uh the letters the wa said that uh they can read they uh some information from the wraps but the man think that they can choose the information from a why i have and if the student uh all the student go to the office and order to meet the advisors uh there will have not enough time for meet ever students there
170,1,i like to have my mobile phone with with me at all time because i think it can use it to communicate with their each other and the the mobile phone is like o'clock with the uh other things like uh the uh i can uh i can um uh can also in in the that uh waste mobile phone uh i can get some information on it it 's the really uh it 's see very useful fuel me uh other since the lag uh if if are or you uh if are and there 's some problem i can uh call you to my friends to
171,1,hm the lecture and these are material during pass it is uh other weathering the university plans to plants that meeting advisor is not well the man 's opinion is that i about this letter um on the man explains that it 's not beneficial because advisors help band and he talks th the someone th and then then they figure out and advisors have a lot uh information second is in convenient uh he cant uh trouble scheduling and if appointment he if he appoint must someone do this this plant
172,1,uh uh using the exam we know that epiphytes it where they they they hang around trees so that they come and be in the canopy to get the sunlight and also they uses tree for support and also and to get uh and they are lees i in the form of a receptacle so they can get water rained we rain rain and so that the plant can continue living i he or known water is is used by plants me uh to transport new trends and also by by hanging on it fee epiphytes uh the the simply uh they they are it were of any intell find it 's consistent and i think that 's all
173,1,in the passage uh he believes that the meeting with their um advise that will be in the beginning of course the second problem uh that uh which is she won the letter uh is uh uh have to find an appointment uh to see uh the advisor uh the man um is complaining uh uh because uh that if free uh profession uh it 's on th in their website uh switch city an in uh scheduling uh the different classes uh so he finds difficulty uh to find all the performance in the website and tree and finds uh disappo pur find advisor uh because he uh has a lot to wait for these uh reasons the he has at prop
174,1,well uh has a reading the letter the something i completely i really do agree with the completion with and that 's because of uh in the conversation um the grea ants that couple of things was very important one of the things is uh they can get more information from the teachers then as on website of the university and to the several information the teacher would they wo n't be on the website uh something important that websites uh long living there wo n't give be old information which he want you might have some specific questions that website want advance follow their for discussions will be a concert but it is therefore i prefer it will the adaptation about
175,1,well as we on o mobile phone since very useful and popular your daily life but for me i would i would n't choose to bring mobile phone everywhere i go because first cell phone is reading or is it 's home for to have because of the radiation and secondly when you go to some important meetings or to make some important guys uh when the phone rains it 's very embarrassing and and would totally destroyed uh at atmosphere between a in a moun the discussion so i i would n't choose to bring mobile phone any time wherever i were go
176,1,well i prefer to plan make mobile in any situations clear with for good it i think experi comfortable someone speaking if his or her phone in any place in any topic i think to have not any proc when you are speaking you 'll phone so i prefer to live did i ho her for example my sister speaks uh by the phone in every situation in the teacher is about a room or when she is student i think it and this say quality because they read a song for they probably can be from today she
177,1,well the new information that student use ca his to have an appointment with their tutors to choose the locator course the student amy does n't agree with this statement because she think she is a last telling because all the information is on the website and the tutors need to cut the time to disappoint mad the other uh students the man does n't agree with they may because he thinks there is not entirely information on the web is not a diversity kind and to talk on the rented to in which goods expect she he he also thinks that the students they learn is the appointments so they do n't have any time to have it that which would thus it with time enough with with what coff any probably talk uh
178,1,the problem is that uh he will the like he what he will have a concert but uh the place uh on weekend is place uh we can is booked uh the hm them them the one solution is that they can choose uh one day of the mid week uh to play is first solution is that um they cave he could could take the performance with announce band uh i think the uh second solution is better because um i think play on a weekend could uh being me on week they could attract more audience and uh i um and uh and most most or small is if they perform with other other band um it could have man much joyce hm uh so i think the second um solution is better how that 's all
179,1,and the professor is went somebo to expands the idea if a thing is it means that and the plants hm uh adapted to the a life in the forest in order to was uh make us or by work uh first uh the plants and run into the ground and use the tree to supplied any supplied it so that they can get plant of sunlight um uh less uh the second is that uh bra and the we well what small uh the the flower other plants it 's so sing the in the the root this is ruined um um more to together and nutrient for to live um uh the their plants get the plants and use he second other him moves uh to get the and that 's friends uh all the so the uh example the professor used
180,1,the proper so mention in the letter and his to suggest that the meeting uh with advisor is no longer needed um the man and uh uh i'm direct is not agree with that um he is a based on with two reasons that the professor based around you know the first one and that um the he the information on website is basic um rather and the teachers advice uh a huge uh can help you uh the band out more uh uh more courses um needed you know hm um courses and uh schedules uh might can be uh change um but they also could me the uh requirements and the second reason that um the time infor uh meeting and can be rent no not they could make uh by uh the the earlier to to manage
181,1,in the if it it has adapted in i like in the rain forest by uh uh the or uh water in the uh uh first because uh in the first is uh when the leaf of the trees many plants there uh cannot uh uh tougher their peop it 's from the uh they uh uh sunlight or plenty of sunlight uh it can uh um like uh ke uh produce an lecture again that uh uh book could be important will for uh and in second then then the uh related to the water and uh do water will be um offer slice the the uh his assignment then it 's uh epiph it 's uh a could uh they they uh food from uh the waters
182,1,in the reading said that the epiphytes use house off plant as a platform uh but epiphyte student take nutrients from the host plant and it planned about thirty or form the meter high and they could access sunlight but not nutrient from so in the listening uh the example is urn plant they they use tree or chang from the tree to support and they get plenty of sunlight from there and uh they have uh some kind like bowl to restore water uh on the base of it 's and spiky leaves tightly role info now um it helps gather water and nutrient so uh they could get
183,1,um their the problem of this because uh the there are talking about the the schedule of their show so the problem is that schedule and the helped on they do n't have time because uh the place which is the campus auditorium is of uh booked uh by planning when to do it but then they they talked with another group asking them if they can allow them to to presents uh at the same time that 's they share their schedule of tie and that 's how the problem is um and i would recommend uh ants um they they choose their own schedule so that they can show their talent uh because they said that the they are not be able to present will all of they half to show
184,1,um the to re is that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers one is that uh the is she they it 's should be easy for the consumer second uh the appearance s matters to because uh the appearance should be attractive uh so that they consumer may like it um it should be need also because um you should of all it uh the the container which are appea uh in messy so it should be needs uh attractive good looking
185,1,consumers buy pract which are in containers okay with the product is oh or ant so who ever says this products need to first design a container of the a product uh creative create with creativity to attract people to buy it in order for your business to work and be successful also for people who buy your products want the product which they buy second the classy and not messy so that they could place and their homes in order to fit in and uh for example of the living room or something they want something to look more uh classy to place in their homes and to have other people located and maybe could buy more
186,1,i think i would like to take my cell phone kn with me all the time because the mobile phone uh can surf the internet we can use it to hm get more uh many information and and knowledges from the internet and uh then the so can um if you are in you are uh dangerous you are in danger sill can um call help to another people and uh um it 's well uh use useful to you 'll to communicate with not app people um that 's all
187,1,this man is playing a in a band and uh couple of the uh couple of uh months uh they trying and there are uh try uh planning uh and a concert next couple of it ca n't because uh they are thinking and that they are plan planning this in concert before the summer uh because older people uh are going uh every their uh but there is a problem with the concert uh it concert play because uh there is uh uh there is a place uh it it on the campus or auditorium but the but the auditorium is uh did n't open it weekends and uh the people uh maybe the students uh do n't prefer uh the uh a concert in the middle of did't but uh on the other hand uh the uh this uh campus auditorium is smaller on wednesday but another option there 's an another option uh another band uh his uh planning to or prof uh her perform the concert next
188,1,in the rain forest or some kind of uh plants uh and uh mind uh upper layer branches uh break off uh of our branches uh if he plants can uh time a brown and many uh off down uh ten uh and that uh to the rain forest also uh they uh have face meeting um is sound is specific geisha 's for survival uh one of them is it if he 's days uh the this uh plants uh can um cause uh a plant and use uh this uh plant is the fact form so it 's point we can see uh the urn plants that they are uh upper part of this trees old live uh old branches and they are upper part of the uh trees because of the other op sunlights and also they has uh some uh just one single stem inst some to and uh there are uh they ca n't uh be is store th uh the rain water uh ant
189,1,the the problem the uh to s because discussing is about well they do n't have they did n't have time to uh uh hm do the con to do the concert before the summer uh they uh hm the other me uh that the man said uh he just the just had a couple weeks to uh they played couple week and they uh when have a concert um beside they had food friend bank with in uh a might be uh i will talk to help them that they can perform with them they they does n't want to uh they can perform to the concert in the middle of the week but they will not be a lot of audience so um i think that the two pos solution is and they uh perform with the friends band and they would be f for from was it they do good
190,1,he is not uh agree this uh uh the opinion of the letter because he said the pur size is not um have all the information need uh in their besides that and the e um advis advisor has the um extra informations so uh we can from them now uh he may have the trans some ke have trouble for the uh time of the meeting because uh he said that get their the and uh that and get the schedule with the e um advisor is bad his better than um go there for the last our and um the and try to get the meeting because they are the advisor has all the um student schedule so is hard for them to make a schedule for your
191,1,the man is in trouble because he is opposed to perform a concert but the the old aud it korean already booked the top the man and woman talk about two possible solutions to the problem the first option is to perform their cou his concert in the middle of the week weekend and second option is is give a show uh the major of other team it 's per performance i think the for option is better than the other one this uh this is because even the it might be fun plain during the weekend since there is not enough not in a um there is not many concert also is since they are since
192,1,the man 's problem is the place he want to uh have concert is already book the man and my suggestion suggest to the the man and woman suggest two possible solution to the problem first suggestion is to uh play the concert middle of week the second suggestion is to join another band i think the first suggestion is better than the second one if he uh delay the concert uh middle of week he can uh plan he can enjoyed concert and he do n't is to worry about
193,1,if i th uh had to adapt to the rain forest they have to survive because that with a lot of trees in a this forest and uh for that uh there is the use it is uh they use uh or street for support uh to in order to find uh nutriments uh for inven paul the using or street they can grow up a sea and uh the uh uh f uh the uh advance this sunlight and uh also they can uh store water becau but then leaves are has a receptacles uh many insects for in the wet or they compose and uh this main uh liquid fact lees or which it uh uh in a good nutriment for trees and this is i would they can survive in a rain forest
194,1,there are two ways for for that a product uh containers can be used and for for uh uh are customers attractive customers uh the first one is when uh using flexible et pl flexible plastic uh uh for example when you buy uh some food and when you finish your when you finish your food he can use the containers for uh for to keep in some foods and can uh food foods a argument ol also you can use for for for to keep in some materials uh pencils or something adult own all other one is when you use decorate dislike the hours or some
195,1,mobile phone is very important class and a lot mo bottle have mainly many formation and you can use hm where example to come over and break uh and will into lead concerned email and show i think if you litt you can bring cell phone all the product i th uh but cell phone will be absent best thing about the d signed all know so it 's not good for you to buy it so co has
196,1,the man is press um ac university website you but this th th th th it 's not good and to children if the student have problem day to they can use and uh he she sees four five some information and uh th the read i do n't know
197,1,well i ease our lecture weekend bigger out that uh some ca n't of uh uh plants uh in the forest always make advantage of other plants to a support themselves uh the professor hm to go a example of uh are as this ca n't of uh plants uh um always uh um depend an some other kind wo planned to support and uh get more sunshine and the second part a old we can figure out is that um uh its flowers and uh lives uh i also some ca n't of from uh fracture which is a good to and to collect uh much water uh next the leaves uh which uh is it can and collect the much water i with a uh much it nutritions to to the bor and then the plant will girl better
198,1,defined he opportunity i would like to read the dive and she could because i your that 's one of the most read a book uh in the word for meet would be a good point first of all my culture because it 's uh really nice history some friends has read this book and the problem is that should really ready define the opportunity moreover it would be a good point for might knowledge because it 's explain a part of the story and she also or is really famous uh he he is very famous fall is novels you are th
199,1,the epiphytes have adapted to life in the rain forest due to the roots they their planting in the tree uh in the trunk in fact they can get plenty of sunlight is unique shape and their roles industry they can be flower that 's well moreover ro the save water falls down the leads and there is uh moreover sep talk very receptacle for the rain um they can store water and they can also gather nutrients in order to to be feed the that 's the unique shape um it 's uh you these rumors
200,1,i prefer to bring my cell phone all the times because the uh because if i can connect to my friends uh easily if i do n't to uh bring the um bring the cell phone uh i maybe i have difficult maybe i have difficulties putting or to contact with my friends because i have to find out the public cell phone goods and it i think it 's uh very difficult for me so her and an in in a not in an uh nowadays cell phone has city gift with the uh many applications and it people use that application very easily um in concluding internet web certain uh surf it 's uh
201,1,uh well as far as i'm concerned i prefer to bring my me my cro mo mobile phone with me all the time uh first because i think um uh mobile phone is uh uh important uh communication tools for me to communicate or with others uh and i can receive message or send message messy the to others and secondly uh i think i can play uh some mobile phone game uh why i when i have by mobile phone uh with me all the time hm city
202,1,well in this set of material the raining passage describe uh letter on about uh a proposal uh and then uh the listening material is is a discussion between two student about the same topic in the listening material uh the student uh propose uh to uh uh ask uh uh for the s the university to meet the students uh a parent that uh they need uh not only um uh use a website to get to uh information uh and uh also they want to talk with uh the uh other whether uh uh for the uh because they uh if they uh can talk with the advisor uh they can uh deal with the trouble uh who very well and uh the under that 's uh it 's good for their schedule uh for the class
203,1,uh i prefer to have uh my own cell or mobile phone uh the first reason is that um the when i have a emerges see uh events uh i need the help for other and it uh if i have a that uh my cell phone i uh could uh i could uh uh it uh le why find the others uh eight or help the s the s a uh the s can read these then when other people have uh emerges she uh i can help uh others uh less queue
204,1,the man totally disagree with the letter uh sell live class so that is that uh first one is that why debate it uh uh the advisor you can get my talked may extra informations with uh which cannot be so it can order the find their uh on the one side and the student and it 's really ask me because uh uh is not uh fina communicate uh a kind of people at that that is that the leader uh d uh another is that uh the time is not time is not a problem that well uh and it will selling their pro uh pass of the uh uh the so the problem with from ride uh uh problem the uh advice the let 's uh talk uh must uh uh does n't every same to the last a woman said the well they have uh uh people it uh uh you can how they uh product hm to read it uh the advisor that 's all
205,1,because one of the prof things that make the customers uh opinion to the product uh him is uh to make easy uh to make the continents easy to who to came out to to to to came out the product like uh ketchup and to another think uh they can mission it uh present to view tre that makes a customers like the other uh happy with his the own of this the the sea or uh
206,1,man noticed saying that there is no there is no need to meeting with the advisor because own uh because and the advisor uh the bird advice on work is was to select select the courses and advice getting an advice him uh getting information about schedule vision problems but the man so that is not there and he do n't agree with the notice he think that the advisor have a lot of information extra than the website because of the website helps just in the courses of the graduation problem with the process of the of the material but the advisor has out of extra information in could lead you with uh perfect by as which you can trees and and uh getting old uh of uh
207,1,i prefer bring a cell phone with me all the time uh big because or a reasons below uh first of all if you will have uh i think bring cell phone is uh why what wait to con to protect yourself because if you are in something accident and you can you can talk to others for help and for the second you can communicate with others if you have something and that it it need to check in time and you can get the the most a create suggestion or something information
208,1,the woman wants to see the performance of a band and the make uh talk to talk to her a lot of performance that she can take uh before a semester before the summer starts and there is a concert um the woman did i have the title go um the man says and we also had to uh the performance on auditorium and uh um middle of the week and the and the woman say all it will it was okay and i think it is uh int interesting so that everyone will read it and there is another schedule but they 'd appointment and i think the woman attend the auditorium rock performers a be it is the shows but time for her
209,1,uh the problem is that the man have the pen and the practice for a long time but uh they do n't want to uh can f uh performance in the uh special dead at the l i do n't have the uh place to plas there are two solutions to these problems first uh they can they can book another days uh in the middle of the uh the life a second the they can play with their friendly and uh big they can plat i'm or in the opening and the their friend ants play on the rest of the uh the rest of the plas but uh they have uh little time to prepare f of path i prefer the second solution because uh if lect prepare well that they have acc they can played with uh with them but uh uh have a lot of audience to uh party the
210,1,uh the man idea in the lecture is about the um contain is containers which you can uh attract uh consumers to buy other producer text two example to uh il lectured lees containers first to and he believe that talk should be used uh friendly and he said let uh plastic is more backs well to the uh consumers and much conveniently second they uh the consumer can the be pre then the when he when they use the lis products through uh he think that uh if you cookie uh appealing and uh you can uh when should do the cookie ch to you 're tells to so that the consumer mess they are appre than in the the clearly of the product is important so he this is important
211,1,uh uh the man 's problem is that uh they make they make a plants to play uh in get or campus au auditorium but the it it game uh on the weekend and they are they think they 're if when young audience to know and many in the f uh to his uh so they think that and can adjust to their schedule fit out there 's the
212,1,uh the man 's problem this led he wants to have all cancer at the all did n't at the auditorium on campus but the less know free time for him to schedule the concer time the cancer time so he has to you 'll have um have a cancer during a school day uh all he ca n't do the cancer um he ask the opinion fun the female students and he also says another option for the opening cancer it 's like he can perform the can s a with another bands and all um on next saturday but they he could n't perform all the songs he road um i prefer he choose the second option because is better for him to have more audience
213,1,well i'm that kind of people the life of cell phone everywhere because uh it helps me or it kind of uh it helps me to communicate with all people and and it and then i want so it 's it 's or form in a for example if i'm every from my then they can this going it can call him is a and the second one is they i have some music information on my cell phone so so that they can use them every time everywhere and it 's arms easily to used uh the the third one ants like if third answer doctor answer room is because i'm accustom to cell phones so if it if it is not with me i'm not i'm not uh uh feel very very con and uh uh it 's like um use that every that 's it
214,1,doll in though the man has a problem this plain band i ha uh called trick next week the first solution is that he can play the band ad wednesday night but there we a lot of audience the second solution is that he can play with his friends at night however because of their uh a lot of people perform in their band there wo n't be enough time to perform their music everything in my opinion i will did a band at wednedsday ni at occurred their place bec the reason is that it is for fun and they will do n't they do n't need a lot of people to audience their performance since it is not important concert in his like he can have concert next time
215,1,the book i i have just heard from my roommate called a call that uh that that that 's have interested uh in reading it it 's about a daugh rock who is lower to his master uh it it 's waiting air weekday when he his must the his must or come home and uh he he uh he 's master said uh even the whole world test dorm me a cold not uh a call is that for his master um in an accident i cried phone for the rock and
216,1,i prefer to have my mobile phone with my with me am all times because the cell phone is a most effective uh uh uh in matter to communicate with my family since my family in different country moving the different country it 's uh need so in order to comic test uh so uh whenever i miss them so much we miss them song me uh so much we use cell phone because of whenever i use um another method to accommodate or uh with them such as email at is and song there are responds is a reels grow and sometime the re um intentionally good of my words so i prefer uh bring cell phone at all time
217,1,uh the prof through the professor explains about the urn plant which uh um which is a test to host tree and uh uh so so it can a lot of sunlight and its name is because it 's leaves is are shaped like an urn which is is a bowl and the bowl shaped leaves can actually enable the plan to store water and also some ca some other nutrients to requests in the bowl to uh decompose and make nutrients uh for that uh epiphytes they they also have access to sunlight but not not enough nutrients in the store about have other special question they ca n't it seems to overcome that
218,1,i prefer to have a several phone to having know them uh first i can solve the many difficul problem be but i have bus cell phones to be specific big there are many keep occurs duration but if i if i have not a cell phone a concert and i can see the second i can contact with my family of can dairy my family up uh for the reason i prefer to have a cell phone i d d d d
219,1,one way to design uh product i container of the product to appeal consumers is to design it very much pract mature like for instance of they kept top out of ketchup um using flexible plast plastic it could be used very imp much more easier and much more yeah much more problem active second um it 's to designed fully to if it 's like something that was mentioned about cookies like if you designed which the you can display at home in think it 's quite really good to look good and it will look nice and classy if like even though you invite friends you should you can just show them and break them or something the school
220,1,i prefer the first one uh that is the cell phone or mobile phone should be with as only uh because uh the main reason uh was to we can maintain of the cell phone was written some important calls um concerned uh to use some um as um solutions on weekend shade any um things without uh the friends and uh the cell phones should be with does because of the um because uh the main reason that uh we uh they can more are those and we can can with uh old uh message to them and there are very important and they should be with as uh only uh this is my feeling uh that is the cell phone mobile phones will does only their uh less study knowledge
221,1,the problem uh that the speakers are discussing is mainly about the hm uh with music performance uh switch as we given in the um campus for a couple of uh weeks uh for a couple of weeks uh fo food for which uh the um for which if he he had to had to give in a couple of well which um and uh the guitar uh by the cho in nice campus and um his worried about the uh that the uh of the of the eat oper two weeks it is the summer that all the students will be one of from the campus hm they really um known to cheating up uh um in a better is to give uh uh oft or they is uh some other record uh see them bible it is uh the uh these the man uh mis of his friends uh what their to state up uh uh his computer split a playing it uh
222,1,uh in my opinion uh i prefer to have uh my a cell with me uh add hard th eyes because um if find sense if i have a problem uh if re hm it 's uh someone as a plan and the person uh really be advert would run need and uh if i were bir to to be a which and ants uh s creation or uh it 's see tree ci and uh it 's it 's important to have to be a d run uh borrow cage
223,1,uh i prefer to have a mobile phone because and agreeable person and uh as i'm working now uh the kind of all is great uh busy end i want to be connected in immediately when there is uh emergency occur and another reason is i think the cell phone now is much more much more easy to terry because out that has a uh aspect which is very small and really useful that i can use is not only to talk and
224,1,the afte fis sides uh has adapted to the life of lend for rest uh by several actions first they low the a location uh they usually uh grow on the goal by wrapping the root all the trend of the host uh him and this will exposing them to the sunlight that they can uh get the sunlight to um uh to do s um uh student new nutrition for them and the second reason is uh that long leaves and uh the for mater if that they can form its screen the if the in a cone and to to receive the water from raining for a
225,1,i 'd like to have i have my cell cell phone with with me all the time rules because they will using the cell phone i can uh i can contact with my friends and my relatives uh recently and uh quickly if there are the of their ins um emergency dead having to the in and have n't when i ca n't there is a news and uh and to some action to pre meant is the the situa prevent the situation getting getting worse um and another reason is that i can i ca in the ten myself views my phone
226,1,well i interesting book uh is a problem her uh it 's my friend told me as a nice book and it taught she what is uh parent is and how to face to uh is problem and uh she uh not uh from is book uh do n't fear every saying uh and she will things for is book hm to uh in rock uh she to leave his and uh her life and and uh hold improve uh her con confidence and that is why by interesting in i want to leave they are too
227,1,uh i have some interesting books so west since i 've never uh reading uh the first thing that i live that is given given in uh give a new given now is n't ano uh and then entire readings all sur it gives me uh relieve my stress sometimes that i have get that i can guide in so offer tr eighty so release reason i like the reading this book interesting reading this books
228,1,d like to have uh my cell phone because d my friend thi planned uh relieve to way i to wait to city so d d i or a show i would re call might and to only chan the secondary d d i have um i like to have all my example because uh i have or d reason who 'll d so i call uh have the
229,1,so the explain how emphasizes have adapted to live in the rain forest i would uh like to said that the um the urn plant um got along dream um and um putting the the rain around and them getting all we 'll be supported by the tree and uh they they are going into the ground the tree or a bit high up um to get energy from the tree and uh it also helps other nutrients um to land on the leads and um they have a quiet uh uh food storage um with it
230,1,the problem of the life in the rain forest is that to the sunlight cannot has to to the plant that it 's that it 's grow on to the surface level so the some plants such as uh urn plant which is which grow and uh they holds tree have that it 's mechanism to cope of this problem the urn plant uh bowls they believe that can use store a water that is dropped from the from their host plant and additionally this water can have a nutrition and a better and then it so it can give him
231,1,uh the letter is about to eliminate the meeting with advisor for the students the man opinion to this proposal is it 's not agree with the proposal alone he says he said that the the it 's by are discussing about the applying a cost with professor should the more helpful than just looking through the internet only because advisor can have an extra information that is not available just find the website he also state that their student who propose these must with for his last meet to to arrange the with thing
232,1,interested in reading one hundred years of so lectured it is a book of the realize the amo guess and i think it is a very good work to read because there are other cerem mark is is one of the representative authors from the that in american boom so hearing made uh this really innovation of the magic rev using in which are too and that i think every expan a ke uh talker should read to increase it 's knowledge about it 's panic they church room uh
233,1,the proposal is weathered meet uh advisor for not for the for the helping in the course uh for the better uh for the best to the problem the man uh uh uh he he do n't agree with the uh with the statement with the with this opinion because uh he is in in the opinion that though the website has a lot of information but he said that the advisor has lot of well uh extra information which can help the student to choose the course it accordingly and they and he has no problem uh to me to arrange the meeting with the professor and he suggested that um to meet the professors taught uh arranging that a meeting and uh when uh before one week and get a just get up a li and go to the office and uh uh get meeting with the uh professor uh as accordingly ant uh uh he has it uh he and uh he has no problem at all for arranging this ma
234,1,the man disagree with the position that concer meeting does n't need for students before school start to what he what he serve was that uh figuring out all credit interest also has all different times are be nation which is pre good to students to now and that 's all weekend does not all we can get from concer and they did n't the man and woman did n't even have any problem with the meeting meeting with the counselor before the school source so men disagree with the man disagree with the position thank you
235,1,i was kind of interests at old book um such as share sk spear but shakespear is used uh used old english like bridges language they he also create his own language so it makes it this book miss me more interest and i never had i never had experience to read book get so i lecture read old language book and i'm in th also in test he 's his languages skill uh
236,1,buying product uh does lecture talk a buy product and buy product is contained buying contain the pr product is consuming designs very im important to for brand hm for example um the by food in the market is n't that freshened girl and not delicious but and but the by the make it could in the home made and delivery will deliver to the house hm is might being um with the good plast met uh metal box with pictures present the co cons guess and when people have much more of of feeling um people like people the word because home made more healthy full and the more clear and more fresh ch
237,1,the male in the conversation show an greatly against about universities recent decision that is in the university a intend to um intend to um make student to search the information on the website and also the uh limited some meetings however the male things that uh the we information which students can find on bulb side can also hm learn from different classes but not in the not only uh internet and the students who uh have no idea about were question should have more chances to uh to have made and to overcome he 's problems so uh to sum up the students the male is
238,1,the professor described own friend shape and uh this shows the uh how a picked his have adapt to life in the rain forest first he is and that urn plants have a unique pla shape cone shape and eat help to them to store or uh it is uh uh half for to them to uh adapt to the life and it is really kid a fertiliz and helpful uh them to live in rain forest uh this shows the epiphytes uh um live li in forest the in forest and if use the host plant and it can not take good nutrients from host plant but access to sunlight uh it is similar to the urn plants uh uh get plant give sun life from
239,1,one of the moles uh one of the special decide of the container is to make them use as friendly and as conveniently as key ca n't like those pu product side many acts uh they would like to use pract flexible cracks pract take sk containers so they can easy you to use not like those class containers and another way of using them is to make them as pleasing as we ca n't like those cookies they can put them into he metal box instead of by caught copied box and they can even quotes beautiful pictures on them so they can be much more pleasing when they uh serve those cookies to the guests they want
240,1,um the lecture talks about hm by him uh containers that to the be attract to the consumers for example like uh capture mine his con um container should be um attractive uh also uh convey and also it 's more convenient that uh this container so uh this should be uh friendly for the for the consumer also should have a pleasant a party and uh talked a parents like uh like a books a co uh cookie rocks that it 's um more t could more classy uh a metal box than uh paper looks uh also made a metal box could be decorated with pictures that if you have uh um guest uh would be um wiser to present name in a metal box
241,1,the male student is a this on deciding where uh whether they will uh perform on wednesday or said at it at that i believe that this and if they pick saturday the that will be good for the their band which they just initiated the firstly using is a on saturday compared wednesday there are a lot of audience they good it 's it 's before weekend and secondly the um if they since they are band what 's just newly form th it 's good to have them to have someone fu some uh other band tool work with them uh in this case uh the their friends band is the asking them to play before them so it is a good chance every it and lastly there and uh when he think about audience the audience is coming for other band but they going to listen to his band which will be increasing the
242,1,it is about talk about uh n side at and pur fights um the professor give an example of the urn plant uh he said about uh it is a branch of the trees and uh it is always live in a high of the tree such as the camp appea ant what about they store water they always make a bowl and a sha shallow shade um when the rain is come down it will s the will store the rain in the both and where they get the nutrition is uh is the insects get lives and which will watch down and the fir also can benefit from the plants and and something else
243,1,uh the student are discussing uh announcement uh over uh school newspaper and announcements talking about uh may jane uh sorry the advisor meeting is no longer required uh in that a boy disagree with this announcement first uh announcement says that uh the uh information a course information uh o available on the uh school 's website but the man the man 's argue that you because uh they are only by six information of the clothes class uh and the advisor have a lot of information and uh they can see you shou his uh the second uh announcement says that uh they are not chi ant meeting but the man argues that their only always wait for the lend it
244,1,the speaker has encounter an uh encounter a problem that with that she should choose the next wednesday or saturday to to perform on letter prof the perform letter there a or the top band as far as i'm concerned i well not choose the wednesday because it 's in the middle of the week so the audience is not enough and uh le uh they will be much more audience on the saturday and they can play with their friends our stage after and enjoy it is short better
245,1,the students thinks not it is it is necessary to the schedule meeting uh to have someone to talk with you my fight a talkative to to to get your or a necessary requirement for graduation uh he 's a suggest that if you schedule the meeting in a early party time you 'll you will have easier easily you will not have the problem to schedule meeting and you cannot always cause to have all the necessary information on the websites is ne are another alternative or other ways
246,1,the man opposes not uh the letter that the students should not meet the advisors he has two reasons the first is that uh although they are a basic information on the website but um and that uh the advisor have more is have more extra informations for the students like an choosing the classes that is to fulfill the requirements and in uh and if there 's some want to talk to and to the student will be better and uh the second reason is that uh there is no trouble in scheduling a meeting with uh with the advisor because um they can just the students can just call others called office or do something else but uh there is only one problem that um in the only they only at the last possible they will be traffic in schedule but other days are very okay
247,1,the proposal that uh the abou about so stop uh about the stop op meeting be a advisor before the think it will semester uh there are two reasons first uh the information has already d uh or week showed in the uh for uh website by all students and the second reason is uh it is very difficult to uh find meeting time for students and advisor his opinion is that uh the he does not agree with the proposal because he he thinks the information uh as information is not enough and and uh
248,1,okay there are two different ways uh uh that uh products container can be designed the first one and as example we can uh take uh the container of the ketchup is that the container has to be strictly uh easy to use and so uh for example and were be their plastic can uh container uh instead of a glass one uh like the past and the second uh a very important point about the container is that he it has uh to be uh attractive them and so uh to appeal to the uh customers uh to the customers uh we of thinking that for example they can prefer and nice metal box or for a nice with cell uh instead of a plastic one or the would not one because uh yeah te uh seems uh more uh uh build it seems a beautiful and it seems uh more nicer to to give be sque it 's set tou ke uh guests uh you need
249,1,first of all i like to produce my so and uh under great uh it 's student in a uh music department so i i have to to know may need many different area of music lag like uh classical music flap busy and also or just he 's her his and so i 'd like to to to read a book about that hers history and uh a se second reason of of why i 'd like to read this book is uh i think i think the lectures is the uh
250,1,the male students that is that uh he just started a band and he play it uh guitar and uh they would getting to start at concert on uh uh wednesday time uh he sen the the concert will on campus and because they their prey uh playing rock n roll musing it will be loud and uh so that comes that will be outside but the problem is uh he 's that that in the middle of week and he he said maybe they will not be much more much more audience and the other problem is that uh it wo n't have much time to peers so maybe he they will play and also in my opinion i will play only old song because it will be these much more prepared so
251,1,i prefer to have my phone some inform about from with some with me all the time uh i have two reason i had two reasons first um we must or uh unlike uh uh we have a lot of people uh need to clients every day so univer cell phone uh to communicate with them uh second uh uh if uh if you parents um will student the mean who was you uh you needs and they can take a cell phone with you uh they can uh they can will you our uh uh follow the time uh they do n't they will be do n't were over about you or about you
252,1,this is about it is a decision about uh mess band and uh uh that 's uh that 's not want to uh uh make music how with his band uh an a ready to have a concert um glass and uh he want to of that and also by his concert before summer and all people uh are of your go uh he will play rock and grow uh a city and ha and say uh tell you know wh when into uh wi wi wing to open the concer uh so he as rain uh he because some solution uh first uh he can play hates uh uh on weekends uh but uh a lot of people do n't li school uh uh and also they in second heron is uh it was day but there wo n't be many people they uh as a time in school uh he also can the serves also can play a band with a police another band to show uh
253,1,a friend the lecture we know perfo and professor is that is uh taught uh talking two ways uh uh to uh make uh ca uh container ge somewhere appearing uh to on custom uh cause a consumers uh the first stud and the first but sun is make uh ants contacts my friend in and convenient and for user uh he give example about uh o on one is uh a once people your classes and to and pose a present uh proposed contacts in uh others and some people in plastic uh to posed the conduct seeing a spilled another people buy it uh the second to design is a give a um ca uh ge you are uh give or decoration onto the contact uh give example about uh uh homes um co co or he okay uh the use and decorate uh has uh decorated the products and it 's an well
254,1,i that much um with great those the cup they could uh mention in should steam in this book it is uh important critical book but uh is it 's about to be asked way uh i am a jone this about to compare stated so i have not read it before so i'm very interesting it 's bec i think it 's it 's very interesting in the guy helping me in my job
255,1,i want to read of uh the name is much more story and then i heard that book from my friend then he told me the stories about the society and that how to leave and how to take care of family because when i turn to twenty five i we get a child having her family to live reading so the book it 's personal or life learn the writer it really hand a better experience so he talking about it
256,1,the professor in the lat said advisors before the beginning of every semester they have to uh they had to meet the advisor for need help but the student disagree with it because there is some of the information in the website and then you have to wait for uh having conversation meet advisor but the student but uh the other student disagree with this idea because the website has only basic information and then many people cannot kn know everything by do website so many advisors can help to figure out and then advisor can can help students read many information and then if you call or go all really ste schedules me uh discussion will be easy
257,1,uh the problem the speaker talking is that they are me has the uh there uh there is a bank already uh build of several amounts and is a guitar are club uh and they want to show an summer and uh they want shown so before from and they want to uh older a place to uh have or they show but uh offer the net play one of the place in campus already booked by other other activities so they prepare to uh have a show on the male of another week and uh and that they are playing rock and roll so they are worried about hm no uh there is no audi audi as and a sma a small audience and there can they prepare to uh together uh play there are uh play bank with your friend who or side and their professional and i recommend that this is very good
258,1,i prefer to not use cell phone all the time they using of cell phone will disturb where the water the work or you 'll you work due i taking when you are work you do n't want someone to does disturb are you are a lot on the other hand the when you are sleeping uh if you as your cell phones uh it will it will disturb grow your sleeping quality seconds reason why i do n't want to use the cell phone all the time is the cell phone will will have radiation all the time to will it will is helpful to he 'll health
259,1,the man see find his friends uh form the band uh they are preparing for a concept in the next few weeks the problem is the the audi in tre in the campus are all booked out in their next uh weeks that he has two choice is one is to perform uh wednes wednesday night so another one is to perform on saturday night uh before uh a band that perform at the night or before uh as scheduled i recommend him to book the auditory on saturday night on wednesday night it is important to have have there are or songs to perform the because it is their first time it will not be disappoint the bu
260,1,that i do n't is the lecture i am d i want to read because that talk written by and buy what i after he reading the d d you want uh i think that dor that not will talked about of his how you explain how when d when there is not only does the most important thing and with do d
261,1,the product container can be designed to appeal to consumer by by uh by the calm opinions convenience his and and the looks of the degration for example ketchups and man is is very flexible in the plastic forms and we can squeeze them and another example the nice they create box and talks but cookie is it would it is look nice and we can we can feel feel to
262,1,urn plants have with uh urn plants have unique shade and this plant is living in in the upper part up the another are host tree it is because this plant can get a sunlight more than they host tree and the second point is that urban plants can i can watch watched the insects and another things using the rain rain sh our and get nutrition
263,1,the problem also is talking about the graduation requirements as a school and the uh woman who write it down thing it 's not necessary because the meetings i had to schedule and the all in the all the information is all located and website of the schools and uh in the listening part the man is not agree with that woman who write the if the who write the paper because he thinks it 's at the same thing we can f i am i or the on the web but some for a some problems or some information we can find it directly on the website so it is easier to acts as and uh meetings with the teacher
264,1,the dorm mainly talks about the way that a products container can be designed a piling did n't buy with his quest he gives us to it so she could that will example one is plastic conta and people will used um glass container his about first container is very park spoon and on variant is the second is talking about rising it um if the school or double
265,1,there was a very important lecture there are talks about what uh uh a very important uh and uh sensitive ideas we have this uh subject stead the from it is or all uh side this and such others it is uh also start that uh carefully and with a lot uh of it it is and examples that gives us uh find out and gives uh bus are not down the that he use huge amount of information about it
266,1,okay do n't depend the person that need the cell phone song person have uh business uh who have saw and s own works that it 's necessary have the cell but if but the person that do n't have this acqu patients it 's possible blo in necessa his possible do n't use they use this ad device because sometimes is do n't is cell food for for uh for the this is my reasons
267,1,d and i want to introduce the book which named harry potter it 's uh i know is a book which are term by talk are boring uh english with fame or writer and uh it 's um had been also popular in the word so i have no time to read it but i'm very interested in reading this book because to the book describe a medical word which which are the uh in the is a boy and and in the book and one if i i think if i read a book i will be uh i will be amaze by um the stories this it is quiet reading it i will have my time to read it and all they down
268,1,uh the ant in the newspaper talk about changing the uh their uh advising process from that there 's not to there 's on to for from the source version to uh would advice uh online advice uh that 's what the uh uh i 'd s discussed but they are uh and and the uh uh students opinion was not uh he do n't agree uh with the basic o uh he do n't agree with the with the with the with uh the ants because he he want to meet his advisor uh because his advisor has more food information and he in team me uh pace uh uh any problem with the recent in the classes so his advisors better and
269,1,d d d he to i ove stuck i do i d problem uh i d d d d or that is to th th th th so i do n't dull to does is i do with do ease to de th th th
270,1,this conversation the student students the man have a problems about the time conflicts that he plays guitar and there are um and he need to prepare all or songs and uh to give is pre pro pay and uh there are two ways to salute the problem that there are no way to will play it the first is uh the it really is not of at weekend but over here to mass their o'hara distant more a night and but is small in this the and the second read secondly is that if read give that and offer that they can go to other band inside the in the play a waste hair uh for his friend and this his his get or i agree a second one because it 's more it and the convenient to
271,1,in the lecturer the professor mainly tell about consumer buy products always fault use on the design to re invol s his theory he give several example the first example is that container must be use friendly he said and in the past there is a container made of glass and he can contain a lot of my c products but another another container uh can take away busy and convenient the second example is the appearance of the container is sourcing maybe cans such as a company made a cookie he can design the container with metal and a lot of peter and this appeal consumers a lot
272,1,the passage many talk about the uh he did that tree impor us that theory in the profes show or gives several example he said that the n plant it 's very specially because he live in the branch of uh upper ap high plant and he can get food sunlight the shape of leaves can store up rain water and this is unique the second opinion is that is she the nutrition is from these compose plant and in the water they are alot some nutrition so that how implying can survive in the upper of the tree d d
273,1,the products container can be designed to be appealing to consumer have two ways the first way is uh friendly or a convenient to use uh the example is that a hm originally the ketchup back is um contain in the class but um he can in changed into the plastic bag that more convenient to use and that 's to attract to the consumers and the second way is is a nice appearance um for example a cookie cookie box hm cookie box in the hm carbon box is more not attractive but in a metal box with beautiful picture is more nice nice a hm ap appealing to the consumer to buy did
274,1,uh the speaker in the lecture is talking about uh unique plant me calls epiphyte day 's um he mentioned that this this unique plan is um well in a and rain forest rain forest and it 's have an very unique because it um grow on the uh high tree higher bend it so it can get some sunlight from the top and the second unique character of it of it is it 's shape he has a hm i think that is a back like back like um he can she 's store the water from the rain and it 's and it 's back can um uh also uh insect friend leaf and the with
275,1,uh the professor talks about how ants is have adapted to the life in the rain forest uh uh he uh the professor talks uh according to the professor because the con con appears to dance for a plant to grow uh it 's hard to get nutrition the branch oper truly the plenty of sunlight uh it uh the the store waters prac leaves cone or can each energy and to uh bowl into down to store in the bottom the plants give wash should down decomposed in these released plants or the
276,1,now ebay hard their own my uh cell phone or my problem uh because uh time they can contact people around first of all uh that is just a contact much chain bul i i do n't when uh rain time every time because when people speaks they do n't when another people bad land and uh second um the cell phone second no it 's so strong that uh it 's not health for peoples pour day then uh if he will bring there were where they must they need uh bring the polar thing of with them so not not bring cell phone everywhere it 's good choice
277,1,uh in the listening paragraph uh the uh and it child some something about the products are a container is ch um firstly uh container is is very important and is use age possible uh secondly uh it is much more uh useful to give others uh an give the containers to experience uh such as cookie is uh uh for example uh it 's looks nice and is looks classic um sorry uh they uh they give the food twos something uh to give some by um and uh give container sh to experience
278,1,the book that i 'd like to read it 's me more my more east of a days the reasons are uh uh several are uh the first one is that uh i i have seen the film in the cinema and i am and uh i i like it a lot uh it 's uh the story of a uh case are in the in nineteenth entity it tooks uh about the difficulties on it talks about this he could design also th the they an uh problems that uh this uh woman had to uh pass through old he uh her life
279,1,in the lecture the professor talk but talks about uh uh and device which means that uh is uh use a host plant as a platform and first he talks about that um this plans uh is uh this crack this find is while it make uh uh has a were image shape um they always has a uh has a bor in the base of this uh uh in the base of the plant and uh this bor is used to store water and uh it all also have some long still s uh uh over the plants and uh this and there is a bores uh op the basis is need to store water and uh put some uh natures
280,1,is the plants that and the lecture state uh course truth or about how uh because they want to uh to some weiss but the has they they not but uh nutrients from the under cause so they need use hm make this ants like they have unique shapes like to talk to rather encourages and then that about that all us to plants together right nutrient in there and also they decomposes one there 's an gains explai so they could get nitrogens or under the sources they could it uh yeah sta what uh plants adapted to life in the rain forest
281,1,in the listening passage the teacher mentioned that the customer buy the part and not only the product but also the contain like a brand or of the okay the less two example the first one container should be friendly which means convenience to use which will make you may use the product be faster and easy uh teacher mention the ketchup as example before ketchup where you daily mess your spoon or your food but now they change the new new container who uh will make you 'll to decorate your food or use the ketchup more easily and the faster and uh you want mess up your things the second is you need to have a place appearance which make make you brother and put the in your home can can like a the decoration your house it 's a cookies example
282,1,in the lecture the professor tells uh introduce the prince their which means and consumers buy the product now only aware of it ca n't thing but also aware have the designing have the production um ants and uh the professor get some uh the first is um be uh the first a design is to kept convenience to use for example a container is um uh are used to be class bett uh now it 's can be uh more can be need to use an extract uh it 's very attract the consumers the second is um pleasing appearance for example cookies uh and cookies a self in a nice metal boxes with before pictures which can which is who look nice and classic and to the people who eats uh uh cookie will feel very pleasant and
283,1,the professor talks about the buying contain product and there is couple ways to like uh more better the like uses possible at first of all uses possible like it for example like class elect for ketchup or mustard if he if fish in the class that you can like pole all over your played and they can build like really messy but a plastic you just little sque is they can nice and little ketchup or mustard under the food so they could be want and lastly uh like for examples s cookie like selling cookie with um mole the ne stea bugs or like clean box select selling cookie with nice ke matter box with a them beautiful design and uh uh that people that more pro oper
284,1,i'm think in reading a book of interest in team he 's uh heard a lot about this book and about the contrast that they brought with a with a this book in the in the in uh in the in the world with this book i hope it is not like the previous from uh the than accord some seem in that case it will be uh just pla ancient really of the has booked it is familiar with these uh in this case i am inv invented me so much and before ch
285,1,uh the there 's main like two ways the first is to um make solve containers convenient to use uh people you july to um contains or commitment to use the classes and a nowadays they use plastic containers because when they was classes it is uh it is easy to get missed up and uh uh when you have flexible plastic you do n't need to move of the lead and is first time the second is that usually makes or a containers um hm much more appealing on the appearance um people um have nowadays to uh to contains a food with some metal box and also with some uh pictured um picture under or containers and in that way source uh cookies will uh seemed classy classic and also make um people more willing to buy it so so base cause years uh two ways to computers or appear the consumers
286,1,two would be a pro my thing because you they have this concert on wednesday uh they will in have not so much audience and uh uh they will be not so popular but next week on saturday they can perform it with their friends and then perform at on wednes because they will train there and some people see them they will tell about their group to another people and then more people they come and they will become more popular and gain more money i think it will be better for them because uh there is the best way to do it because this woman said this way is not really nice but this of what i say i think will be more or helpul for them and p pe
287,1,the problem consisting uh in uh difficult way of giving concert by student who is acc apart for a long print of time by teacher uh he uh who who he want to she wants to uh to to device with your frie at he 's friends bulbs and this is problem and he says that uh all of that the auditorium which he he books uh which he wa he 's going to uh to in which he 's going to present his concert is good they will bring in books for some weeks for sometimes uh before and the uh his friend uh and hm hm they show friend uh his friend uh says that it 's not matter and it possible to process and uh
288,1,i epiphytes adapt to life in in the rain forest uh and uh um urn plants um here from has have a spike leaves a single stem uh bowl at the base most of all uh thinks two shape of um this plants and the water can be stored th and them it leaves uh uh uh it is a possible to find uh great number and not rent um and that is why it is a very invented and on the ch ways or uh for live off epiphyte um it 's uh they may they make no harm to uh urn plants and the urn points and provides ample all necessary nutrition
289,1,i'm interested in reading a book about uh but they can concert to uh his his interest for me by univers his it 's about they uh issue mainly should or my uh a my student in at uh usa
290,1,s to say that they container or the products he 's uh he could important to the consu last to the proud in self and uh i think one way to to the cold container can be decided to appeal to consumers is to be a attractive attractive for their consumer and uh he she like keep to do by this product and the other way it 'll being they container he 's you differ beautiful because they they can bring to the homes for for her friendship and
291,1,the plan is that uh there 's uh swams communism is to go home and do n't uh most time to do the s so water thinking is that they cannot for collaborate water i uh so for the for the other one band whereby to play with do peri along side them announce either and and and and they should her uh i i recommend them to play with uh their friends store diff deficiency adolescent apart that they would not be put when the or their fact is only one he asks or songs but the did a the problem is that if the plant was it a below turn not which is not really good for them i do no one some is not bring them light a dorm but the needed has talk to the needed uh or this but the p ladder somebody would with it with of wooden guest our of their friends but to game the the act you need to they might not be able to play all their songs they have to play litt will be to to four or five of the of their monday business but but they will be same by lect talk crowd a larger audience a catch to the
292,1,they are having a problem deciding hm the time to perform their shoul uh the guy he who newly started band uh has n't uh uh he she did n't of the uh uh he does n't have a private uh place to perform his show so therefore um his either has to um perform in a time when um not so many people are coming or with another band so i would recommend to perform um not to perform with uh the other band because he would get more attention uh one performing their ol and not with the other band
293,1,the proposal mention own order is that the student want to want to remove the system of advisor because he said it makes a lot of problems like like um scheduling times and also the web on the website we can we gather information about that but the but the reader who uh but the readers that the he uh on the web there is only basic informations the advisors extra informations so it 's very helpful and and he have never trouble with the guys who whatever uh advice them so she said the sat up early the scheduling is the most easy thing
294,1,i prefer to have my separately always for the product is as wall it 's the cell phone me to get good access to the phone for example about to communicate with people to be easy for me to take it a common it easily that with the time to having to going with me all the time make it easier for me to send text message to people into the going to look for it so the exam if i need to respond to miss i do need to good to my local where kept it to respond sent to phone is we did a respond quickly this reason why i would prefer to have my cell phone only or deter
295,1,well the man is first uh problem that his band he spends want to make a show but they run they were me no more normal weekend we ca n't um before the summer stop and in order to help him hm the girl suggest him um to to play the show in the me in the middle of the week and um and the and the man has also side that they are another band can help help them and the and the other band invited them to to to play the music before with um before before them and um but the that the trouble this is they they do n't have much time to perform um while in my opinion i think the hm i think the first one is is is better because um because when they are not some people
296,1,um i prefer to have the cell phone or mobile phone um uh for or following two reasons the first reason is that i can communicate with other people wires i'm in the outside of my house um for example my when i go out with my friend hm anyone can contact with me and the second reason is that uh
297,1,um than has a problems with um his concert cause he wa need to have his concert at the campus then um a concert late had uh booked for all the weekends and there is a new ones but that they can have they can book for or next wednesday and he thinks that she this is uh in the meet of the they mid of the day uh there might be smaller audience that who come so um i think it is better for him to uh skill have the concert on wednesday because um then he can perform the songs that they have pri practiced for a long time
298,1,one invi did does n't where people like a customer who buy a pleasant like uh choose when they buying shoes they sometime they uh inside of box and then are able to see so when they but also the box uh attract the people when they buy and sh is so before they defa you look inside of box you she sh or the outside it looks interesting and beautiful arts that watch uh people to buy this shoes uh this consumer uh see this box and also the shoes they have are characteristic for the people so also the outside of box she have some uh characteristic the choose have uh more than should outside of box if the after her box that 's ordinary uh everyone is he has no body on about that 's why i think
299,1,the main saying they have a band and they will have a concert recently but they want to find of place in the time uh but the le the sun uh in summer but the we can uh help they have a place to the no time to to have a concert and to late this got uh uh maybe wednesday bad to the wednesday will places too small so late want to ch worries want to choice may be uh set day but lane will play with about the other bands so that they will ca n't play all the s phone they prepare
300,1,well this is a really complicate question uh uh uh it depends on different condition for different people and for some people they do n't they do n't ha uh like to uh the other people to disturb them and the re electoral uh quiet environment and they do n't want uh uh they they do n't take them everywhere and uh but uh uh for me i i'm a old coming person i have a lot of friends and uh uh i i 'd like to call friend then the uh as uh receive the uh call from friends and uh i like to uh participate a uh a lot of uh activities and the party so that 's why
301,1,according to the lecture the professor said uh two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers um first one is um um make product more hm convenient convenient uh hm so they can use their products so easily and comfortably um second uh uh by designing the products more try mean uh the consumers buying the their products because of uh their products more because they like their duty for degration pieces and it looks really nice and classic so they used and take
302,1,the man has many be uh the problem light is he just want to hold a concert with his band is orient him but uh there no space uh time space in the weekend uh either time uh the woman have provi her two solution the first is can just uh have the holds this cancer in the weekday weekdays uh but there are will be a few or a audience also she can uh uh the man just can uh play with another band uh in the or in them as for me i would choose the second one to uh that is play with an other band is orient them in last said day uh you know firstly in the audi area him there will be more audience uh the hm maybe the can in spear or the band players most also uh you know play with another band maybe we can have some cooperation and other shows that all
303,1,well i pre i prefer have the cell phone uh with me all the time uh firstly uh s and based such a small devices impor kids you can contact anyone anywhere it provide the not only a perfect way to uh contact with uh uh people but also a sense of security why uh in majors have a band happened you can and the a cell phone can a lot help which you uh quickly and the could possible save life uh and the secondly uh there are a lot of all we usable feature is available in nowadays uh uh s in cell phone nowadays uh such as some p history a bid you and game
304,1,well in the lecture professor provide two examples uh to illustrate uh uh two way is um to the structure uh how uh at the top epiphyte is uh they have adapted to life in the rain from forest uh uh firstly uh the uh the the urn plants uh will hm um always live uh in in the branch of the uh if the big tree and they will uh really rich reverse down store water help wat have the tree to store water and uh secondly uh um it uh will help to nutri and to the the tree
305,1,according to the lecture the two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers is are out that one of the them is that convenience because they want to use uh effectively and convenience is very she going if she ca n't and also comfort of all think is very important week for example of ant cookie is with in middle box with good picture it very appeal to consumers so that convenience and con for double mis is uh are very important for designs to appeal to consumers
306,1,according the to the announcement there that university 's newspaper says that occurred it uh the all students have to meet at carry me academic advisor before the semesters because and advisors can help them select courses or graduation requirement accordingly to that conversation uh that man disagreed with these that reading that reuse paper because he thinks that not all advisors are kind uh he has not had a trouble kind of things that on that well f sight so not all students want to meet their advisors
307,1,okay the cannot key and wing forest apart might can um adapted trees are adapted by huge or by using as uh metabolic or uh uh uh mechanism in their own hm use easy ap ap apart can adapt in the survive or in the forest by using it 's own and leaves and root is a uh uh metabolic uh mechanism
308,1,okay above the camp the session the man uh ex but his expressed his opinion is right that uh you wise to you could uh be stand concert the pro pass and he can um receives the many things are busy helped to select case are accus uh okay i think so uh o uh rather than his own website resource thing it is better to concer and receive the helping from the uh professor who as while on a information classroom and he can also guided to asked careful uh it is better to concert and busy to uh with the professor
309,1,i will be interested in reading harry potter for for several reasons first reason is that i saw the movie and it was grade and thus second reason is that i heard my friends uh they the book is great and these are my reasons why i would like to read harry potter uh
310,1,the epiphytes are adapted to the way of forest by take into a tree one example about this appro flight are urn which is made because of it 's unique shape the forms when this they can want to a tree if the if the plan has a shape like they learn that stored water and that leaves or that uh that that get gives the plant provides the plan nutrients and water daily needs for survival
311,1,as a display bird solution act like a fight use host plant as a plant form book grows single situations happen hm hm the urn plants uh parents uh huge uh grow at track of the tree and so that it can have cared of sunlight secondly treat of the um point is is its unique shape it is it is ch urn shape of the urn plant it like a bowl and so that it can store resolve watch this shape also also allow of urn plant to um cha some times will phone but inside it can be washed in the water
312,1,uh according to the passage says that a be studen was uh talk with the concert before uh be at the beginning of the semester fir greatly a to talk about gradually requirements or other other stuff and according to the the listening passage like guide agrees with the uh guy disagrees with the uh his her us of the the reading passage the students required to meet with the counselor before every as much to about the uh greater requirements uh i uh but the lead the reading passage uh uh every things on the website so if you do n't have to talk with uh cousin want to want so uh the according to the listening passage he ge i disagree with the because not uh only cancers uh tell you about gr recommend talk about other stuff as well impor to stuff
313,1,in the lecture and the professor used to point town and points and examples to describe two ways that a products container can be decided to appeal to consumers um for better illustration uh with this the professor show out asked in that um the container are is n't uses impacts small uh and school of um uh containers over your fruits and much in easy um for example cookies um uh nice metal buses and and they eat located classy and this on good illustration th there for our asked to the better understand that the film in and of um uh that a products container can be designed
314,1,i want to read a book that i down interested in but because of the few reason because what of the book is famous in society so i will get and knowledge from that book and also i want talk with my friend about the book what is a book state about and what is the book going know so these two reasons uh make me interested in the book which i have n't read have n't read yet so this is a reason
315,1,i prefer to have a lot from from every uh to everywhere because of uh two reasons first uh from the mobile phone i got a lot of i can get a lot of the news uh in recent news and second uh if some my relationship person have emergency i can know the emergency go and then i can go very quickly if i do n't have a phone i can i ca n't to these two things so that 's why i want prefer uh uh our take uh form everywhere
316,1,the professor stated two types of uh product container can should be and the time to appear to consumers first uh make he uses make it very friendly um the professor gives example of plastic uh materials wings uh ketchup or mustard it 's it should be uh it must be flexible and they use attractive and the second she give uh clea she sh ch uh the material gives the consumer pleasing and feel comfortable uh for example cookies uh cookies uh cover should be nicer
317,1,well the man organize a band and they find she hold a concert and the sto during the couple of weeks but uh before the summer the but there are some pr room because you know first they must um to hold the concert on the prefer to on the weekend but but uh play they hold the concert is a campus um he did not quite um quite free during the day they want to g uh hold you know so they they just a plan she plants you holding on the uh wednesday night but still have some problem and the second is uh the second uh suggestion is that uh he has some friend and they also the for his friend also have the bands and the friend suggest that they could perform together on the next saturday and for my part i agree the second solution because so that the hm counsel could be more tele for in and he interesting
318,1,well as for me uh perf hm uh choose to have my mobile phone with me all the time because it really convenient for me to bring it if i want to know the lessons her news from might help from my parents or friends i can call them immediately and uh i can coming meaning cared with them hm communicate with them uh if i want to the then if i want their then help with my problem is very convenient for me to care care uh cell ph uh help
319,1,the man 's problem is he has uh he had a guitar band by uh he he want and he want he wants to um have a concert uh we can bother it 's not uh be it 's not allow to plate um sunday st and we can so it to made uh six um set they night and uh the other p and she he wants to and the other band allow to perfor with them and she and he le are not have much time to do it is so he not they all the s ours uh as for me now um prefer the second and uh so solution
320,1,when a customer are so buys a product he not only buy the product but also the container uh the two mortality s of making d containers attractive are uh containers user friendly and the example is uh with the plastic containers uh and fi uh and uh there are shown their identity is there is a s glass containers and the other that would be is uh increasing the pleasing appearance for that use use the uh the example with the box for uh can nice so uh or dorm phone any which are and you nice metal box with pictures so there 's this so cracked and
321,1,okay um about the container uh according to the professor talk must be as friendly as possible and has a a p listen appearance uh first of all the friendly uh uh as friendly as possible uh the container must be uh him very indicated for example the food they hm the a container of mo start for example uh should be flexible in order you 'd only ke the the contained i um and uh listen appearance uh it means that uh is not enough the container itself uh any that i mean the appearance uh it must have in must has sorry um uh for example follows or uh a speakers or colors that really appeals uh the consumer the customer in this case
322,1,i would like to read and then the play uh uh middle uh uh weekday with two reasons first day if they are able to attract people what and appeal the talent on they advertisement they might be able to tgether people uh audiences secondly they uh they should play so songs they have played they should play all the songs they have played and practiced to the audiences and this that is the best thing they can do for the audience to enjoy and to think their plays therefore i i like to recommend them to play their play uh which days
323,1,there are two ways that a product container can be designed to appeal to consumers one is the user friendly contain container can be uh it is use leave it is convenient to the people accordingly for example ketchup is to be and glass container it can make uh however it is not changed to flexible plastic container that is more convenient and useful secondly there are there is a attract attractive container the it looks neat and look nicely on the appearance for example cookies cookies can be stored in uh nice metal box that looks more and that looks
324,1,by interested to read about the buttons are look of animal effect chose this is because that uh book is very useful for me in my i in my uh or shop uh also i have there is a book conclude much of a college about any benefit choose this his which he divided it to if i and in features and fi are if i have to choose the seas and bacteria advisors disease is and parasitic very disease that book is very interested and will support so that uh uh sort of fun uh that bu uh is very useful for me in mile in my work uh and the consider also uh practical uh for um uh sort of practice
325,1,uh by uh product container consider one of the most of important uh thing is cons attacked is a customer uh for buying uh in the product so there is no to is it is two way is the uh to design uh a good uh acquire acquire a cover the product container uh the first the first is the first ant to make it uh conventional take a cool cool and for them to to be used again or uh does a customer can use as that of for uh anything is like the plastic container can be use do for other giving the food uh or the glasses can be used which will give us container also what make it uh in be reason time parents uh be reasoned the parents uh so it has several in the picture is a container which are attract a custard uh like cookies which you can be kept in uh i have no in a nice uh uh container have her as lecture uh uh old that attract the customers and
326,1,in the reading passage and in the uh a conversation uh uh give f an an example for the rain uh for the epiphyte uh um is an example is i 've been the in the plant that is an example for the epiphyte is at the tempted they had light what do uh life in the uh rain forest uh this uh brand their grow or high on the trees uh they uh it leaves uh has store uh the water and has a spiky and he 's a or cone shape or far uh finally shape uh they attract is an insect this uh to uh they learn site and the make the completion for it and they take uh than nutrition uh to uh to store the uh life uh the water uh uh what did uh the uh food of the new turns that need uh for the uh life of the uh the plants as a uh the and the plant uh is an example for the epiphyte they can uh serve as a ten adapt their life in the rain in forest and the six there are uh uh foods from the and six sun uh
327,1,they they have big they have big rivers and that and the problem first in the proper for the rocks and because of the causing crossing with the rain forest that uh it i if there is more it has uh it has small it is more rain um so uh so they need to very just him to the new to steam more water um and uh uh they can and there are and they are pour first and their problem for refer cans help surf a lots of for nutrients in the story um so so they can have are adapted adapted to life in the them forest
328,1,well i think a book that i have uh i have not read but uh interest in reading as a cold uh global history to uh because uh i i will read this book because uh this i uh i bought a serious of uh this kind of book and i just uh uh read the uh the first the book and i i know something about uh the history uh such as the uh not something by history uh about the american uh such as the last the generation or something and i really want know much more things about the other countries culture uh about the history so
329,1,urn a plants uh in rain forest adapted to to trou life so basically using using two two ways and the first way to to to stay at the upper of the tree and to get a sunlight and it 's more easy to support their um and the water re is it 's toward the water so he has a uh a kind of his call may kinds uh that he can stall shore the war uh and then uh the near of pop of flower other flower the couple so that 's search to
330,1,i prefer not to bring my cell phone uh with me everywhere because sometimes i 've uh i'm a forgot to uh to set the cell phone to web re and uh if that happens in my class it with uh the stop the professor o other student to to listening to the class uh otherwise um and he is in the library i may disturb other and student um choose and to study so uh i do n't always bring my cell phone with me
331,1,uh the discussion was about the band and the guy he have uh guitar and want uh make uh show uh for uh like the but to like this a care and uh and they that that discussion about uh the time for uh uh at the show uh the uh the guy he want to make it and that uh weekend but that it the she want uh in the middle of week week uh to have a more fun and i preferred uh they make it and uh i uh i will agree with the lady to make it in the middle of the uh the uh i need of the week to uh many they becau too many uh uh to make many many that come to a uh this show
332,1,it 's important uh for their businesses uh to consider how long that uh container uh will attract the consumer the lecture uh a raised two examples in first example uh she uh it 's explain about uh the the container such as a mustard mayonnaise and ketchup s uh originally uh the as a container it what 's used uh old grass it 's but the grass it 's uh it 's very had um it 's not easy to scree so the greater uh such kind of container will change the shape the material into the uh plastic forms and the other example is about the
333,1,the man disagree their idea uh in the letter uh he he admit what the read that it 's say in in part uh for example uh but uh he uh what 's against the idea in the letter for example uh the website information uh is uh very limited and uh he uh he contains that uh advi that advisors meeting ch uh we uh provide more extra information to the student and he never uh have a trouble uh in uh making appointment with advisor so uh he uh recommended do take a early appointment to the advisor
334,1,from the listening bases the problem is come when the guy name steve uh who play band is having difficulties to find space a problem for their band perform so our recommendation is that uh steve so book the space in any follow those pace as a various as possible so that they can perform and this can uh p uh they can fo cools on how their performance and also the other accommodation is they joining the other band to perform in other places this is our recommendation for stea
335,1,i agree to offer books about the require i'm really interested in reading writing an is uh but uh sh tree of material look litter can um uh i like to read uh histories about him because i believe is a very great man um uh is really part at on the uh block community on we will especially in in united states right now we uh a block per student and as a state i think that uh uh books to that he has to reach an and i uh write is that he has to read it as that so these
336,1,according to the lecture when consume an by a pro product they only buy the product but also the container design there are two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to cost consumer first of all to be convenient to use in the pass they use glass to contain ketchup up and the consu many to s green have and usually it mess doubt and it is really unconvenient however now it 's plastic and you just easily pollute on the food secondly the pleasant appearance for example the cookies which in the p plant bor boxes it 's worse than the decorate metal box the consumer would pur the metal box which attract and they looks nice those are the two two main point
337,1,the problem is that the special cries they want to make a concert this has already booked uh and they have a two solutions uh one one solution is wednesday uh to to hold a concert on the wednesday night and the second solution is to hold the concert to the next saturday night to read the at the once i would n't him i 'd recommend to him to take uh the second we solution because because of two reasons it first reason is that they have a much or when they have much audience and it makes them uh very good because uh many audience support them and they can they can prey a music in front of the many audience and the second reason is about it is uh very uh it it is it maybe economical bec
338,1,stephen has band and he steam want to have show next in next couple weeks they want to play in auditorium however it are already booked for our weekends so they might have to play media of the week there is another option for him another band can let students team play together but the problem is they ca n't than they ca n't play all songs they prepared i preferred to the have ce have a show during with during the middle of the week because first then they can play all songs they pre prepared and second other students can enjoy uh a lot
339,1,in the business class professor say up uh talk about the product and uh usually people uh by not only product they lately care about contain project is very important she said very important thinks it 's a contain product and for example she uh she she take some example the about mayonnaise must that and the ketchup borrow they ad made uh a flexible plastic and it is easy to use and chat be kept make messy and the played also uh test and the one more is uh she take a example is that uh the tech ma met all cookies box and there may by metal and easy to display because the the box is designed very beautiful and uh it if they the great bill
340,1,actually i have read uh a lot of uh of box and uh actually i am interesting uh i'm interested to read that side of putting block because uh gets uh it 's talking about uh about her life and have a uh ha and behave like candidates can profession it and uh this p ha actually i'm looking for to playing spark and uh if you days and uh because has a lot of information about side of talent and and her life
341,1,in this part mentions the professor talk about the uh designing of uh products container and she provides two ways and the first way is a uh make a make the a product friend uh friendly on their uh as this product uh such as ketchup uh and uh on uh on the other hand uh he provides uh uh she uh she uh provide uh uh then the second way is uh make the uh product appearance uh uh a nice nice uh and uh uh she provide the two examples is a uh metal box as uh and the cookie box and uh this way can uh make the uh uh customers
342,1,the school implement did a new policy that uh the adver some advisor meeting will will be cancel in the university and uh in this conversation the man hold a negative wills the were this announcement uh the first reason is uh the the information the webs the school website uh only uh only offers a basic informations uh button uh not own uh not the another uh details uh uh and uh if students want want to ask for more inform more questions uh for example is just the different a classes uh they when uh they will not uh to uh get help from from the university so uh
343,1,how to protect sun and out to a uh affects and uh uh buying there are two ways that uh uh in which products can be designed it may be he he as user been has a was very using their uh products uh in a way they would can it used it it will may use uh to me i be easier and mater uh the other way is the that appearance the business is very uh important he will always look for uh instruct uh larger uh it is a that have pleasing appearance for example cookies that would be got uh in meter than it and a paper or uh books i
344,1,this li this reading passage the this uh this listening is about the have an concert uh urn ca n't auditorium but there was to pro there was problem for the booking because the they want to have the band one or one have a concert on weekend but the for the next weekend there is there uh is already booked for cultures so and the second problem is uh um and uh says there are uh he can play next wednesday her he can play with another band but i prefer to having longer culture do n't wednesday to show everything what they 've

346,1,well uh to me a book i have n't uh read and in the is definitely uh very couple filled read an uh by uh because i think is interested to read for several reason uh first uh i think a people get i learn a english by reading a english example uh written but dickens uh because uh my she points advice he 's the like to read read book in the library is quiet the and the english is well written also uh rev stories finding my she 's told me that uh uh their their car is a role model for her
347,1,uh uh the two students in the conversation are talking about uh the announcement is about uh the uh advisor meeting which it should be canceled uh the they then disagrees with any announcement for several reasons uh first man mention is uh uh i website students do n't have auras advisors also he is that uh they ad advisors have extra information or to give uh students if uh the stated at her opinion i was you day choices second uh the man said that he he doe he does n't have proble a schedule scheduling the the advisory meeting the other that most students whether lect minutes ass your advisors while they whether so rock

349,1,the man 's problem that he is a man pla a band and he plays guitar he i'm uh and his their band the well uh introduced uh a concert the problem is when uh when one is that uh the place the time to into due what 's uh this a concert uh they uh he have uh a lot of uh at all times he could introduce it uh on weekend or in the middle of the week he also help be invite his you 'll and his band invited with um another band to in produced his their concert in the um at the next saturday uh but uh it will be uh to want to be time enough to produced his ol um uh song does so i there uh i you see that uh the pressed sp solution a student to do the concert on the weekend so he could and produced all the songs he had been uh part uh uh
350,1,according to the lecture her one of the uh past example epiphytes that uh have adapted to life in rain forest is heron plant urn plant uh chose it 's um uh other plants uh in the rain forest as a platform to grow and it it grow around the trunk of the trees and it 's um uh and uh uh as long as it 's hall it grows around the trees it quickly each uh tall trees and get the sun sunlight it uses uh the s trees to the poured at it has a unique shape uh for much it good it 's uh it 's got say it 's uh need their own it uh uh each uh it 's leaves uh overlapping together and arrangement the water um arrangement the water uh to uh uh it also get its nutrients from ants explode
351,1,book that i have not read yet is wings of fired and out about gr effi of after column and i do n't they were audi there are very sh reason why um interest their in j reading this book one is that it is one of the most in s by getting book it is on the life of of the look alone it is divided on for stage of of the ca learns life and in this book there are very years a same defect down and uh uh walk ability or use so it may helpful in my sense film so i like this book
352,1,uh the man do n't think uh the i ca n't make a adv also it 's useful he think is the can help so that because the office te uh a show very basic uh informations and uh it ca n't affect out the student 's problem uh he also thinks pick uh student go outside to tries the th there for and the way maybe can uh save the problem and uh may be a goal office possible feel harder for the uh cost is and uh you you you can to get the right uh are errors and you ca n't uh it 's it a harder to help you to choice your uh i want to acquire accord the graduation requirement
353,1,de mobile phone is more of a commodity in the lecture very it is use more often d as a organizer dan phone and people use the phone mole from to d d make appointment de give reminders of meetings so should use d and from of deadline s does n't dt send messages to others on the special locations d d the mobile phone has also be used as a universal communication device actors to low level one wherever one is des
354,1,according to lecture d professor says that d who ways that the product container can be designed d consumers first uh he should be convenient to use it what example get tell other uh d can be scr ample if they are uh as a show so um so he can be d customer to de make dam textbook second uh he should each a he can do the example uh signing cookies assigned cookies on cruise um buys what 's in an d example the nice letter passage and it 's i can the di an uh ca n't de consumers d d kids because it 's it 's uh has a nice letter docks that they do n't d
355,1,d d into the letter writer says that students do n't the is high will be does by advisor the man disagree with the letter si idea first he says that he can take the do he going to d courses here gives the and he can get extra information pour he 's professor uh second uh he can um the letter says that all students cannot cannot rains it or uh appointment but students uh with this because example uh student can we are uh ready schedule time they can schedule them people do do n't they do n't part pe
356,1,well uh recently i uh i were te uh uh wants to in talk about a new book which is about will gets and uh i have some interesting in reading it um because i uh be a get is the most uh successful people in the world and uh i i would uh i'm interested in how they how he manage to produce to start a business by himself and second i i want to learn some uh person uh personal uh uh uh skills uh from him and finally i think reading is very good for me
357,1,the professor in the lecture is talking about the container the concept is now uh product container my influence uh well and all of buying of the from the consumer uh is used used for is if use phone honest is important for example a layer uh she gave two examples one is the gas it is the second the other is in the plastic containers for people glasses container is not so convenient band but practice container container if this i and there are many other factors
358,1,the two students in the conversation is talking about an announcement the announcement is about advisor mate meeting may should be canceled and the man in the conversation disagreed ways li announcement because he 's first it 's things there are still difference is between meeting advisor or and reading the advisor and the information and uh basic on the basic information and web he things advisor can provide more inve extra information and um and um and for example the graduation or different classes he can take
359,1,in the lecture uh gives uh two example of uh uh success for design of for uh container our product in an one is to make the container uh convenient to uh to to to use a hm he and um lecturer give and uh give an example of will plast uh plastic can of plastic can chain or as uh uh which can be use the uh to a store things and store other things and uh i like the example the lecturer gives uh uh his uh uh to makes the um container uh um uh um to to mates contain a make uh uh customers feel please and cau for the bar he uh she gives example of film in cookies with um nice boxes as that can and appea uh uh to
360,1,the reading passage talk about he perform inside to hold the planned hand phone and uh it absorb her sunlight but much uh nutritions and in the listening passage the professor talked about the urn plant it 's a plan to tree tree um for it have support and to slice in to blo um it have some stea fi and tiny will a time for is some other shapes like the for shapes and the leaves is grows in the real uh and the you need and ke thinks it is they just get to water inside get per in the washed down nineties storm the water get they occurs uh
361,1,in this material the professor explain two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to the customers the first one is to make containers friendly to people and convenient for people to use uh she said uh once a company use te uh container uh which text or it 's class and changed and design eight and into f um flexible container that 's walks the course the class last lecture may make their uh stuff so uh the seems uh became messy and flexible can container can be uh people can use it scree rate and it is more convenient another reason is that the par using a pleasing appearance that s uh he says once uh could company use appear uh a nice uh appearance an
362,1,according to the conversation we know that the man is guarding start a band and flying to have a concert in the campus all of the members a rarely pretty busy and the campus rock and ri is very loudly so they can just uh schedule on the weekends but here is a problem uh they they are busy had there no more we can s before the summer so they had to span the concert on the when this night and this man be attract um less audience and for the another choice is that uh another band in that the man to expand to take the concert with them in my opinion i think the second choice is better because play with the other band may new lose peoples and get communication in the music
363,1,the problem the speakers are discussing is the availability of the auditorium in the college the solution i would recommend is that they take the are going when he is available and they can perform the or like if the if the problem is that mainly take the or right or my performance we cannot prepare the you cannot uh very in the or might and if you should man perform all all the songs on they are the audience but i i recommend that if he big lady before the night and he if we are ready uh at the time of the respond the computer should be up uh perf should made uh but all the performance that lady by the night it it 's not better to is not better to pa good make practice be they be night itself and the before the uh presentation it is better to book the before for the preparation
364,1,uh you can has mobile or you uh can uh do n't show if you ch have them about it is uh not uh good for all half if you uh if you are they can uh which you all the time and if you do n't have a more about summon uh when you uh you need to to go uh uh she uh could n't i thing to that uh uh everyone is uh to have uh she 's or a mobile but uh not to to bring clearly seen uh all the time uh and that 's all
365,1,well the man uh or most another very satisfied with the proposal in the letter uh firs or war and uh he just um um have not uh h n not you to search all the information on the website although the information open to everyone and then the effective or the the that is not uh come hel uh it cannot be compared with the uh the meeting and and uh at the time because the face to face communication more effective to and so some problem of the student uh what 's more and then uh everybody have the schedule of the task or the uh time but you know the proposal on the letter is the uh it can make all not everyone be uh this order it uh because of the proposal and
366,1,from the listening part uh we know that if uh if you want to to design product 's container uh designed to appeal to customer first of or you can make it easier to use that means user friendly uh maybe you can use a flexible plastic containers so that the people will use it more easily uh second the design can also be plea can also have pleasing appearance it can appeal to the customers following example uh for the cookies maybe you can meet maybe you can design the container uh in the form of nice metal box it and you can also decorated so it is more attracting and when the when people use it uh and he will use it it 's seems more classical for their friends th th
367,1,i protects container usually used two ways first they use they make the product more friendly for example it is the uh the uh the the glass have partisans usually have some got gas next for the container we weeks makes the lect first second them may in they makes the product more pleasing for example the the good books that make the books nice and the in uh i with some before teachers and so it will look nice and the and the people were proper to buy it
368,1,the man does n't agree with this letter because some ten uh on well at different idea uh and different in for my son it 's break on the website uh so he some hand he he 's some trouble like uh some in a few in for my sign if you sk at all it not cons rare on the website so might need it might him confused him if me uh it might him at along hand to very stud the crack in some and that 's why he he he do n't like uh he 'd what re these a letter some in for my said need to uh to ride there on the schedule um but uh on the website something a convenient for he uh because of the g informations queue the
369,1,i pre cannot to brea by sto call um there are two rese why first of borrow um uh and this action can the for uh other peop for from know if he in public space um also um my country uh using the point public space sick is uh a low in a conce a low le so for this is reasons um i am
370,1,the professor talks about um the impor tells or container hm the main point of container uh as um first one and the company more have to made the container more convenient to used by um consumer in the past uh um some company made it container uh to in their class bird it is that could uh before uh many of consumer um it is better are using to plastic contin a rather than uh glass container because uh is he can
371,1,um the speaker are an disag example for urn plants uh and vertically with the uh the structure of there is a kind of plants uh for instance this um in this uh uh leaves of this the uh of this plant they build uh the structure of the bowl which uh helps forms and to take water from from rain and to collect this water or for for process of for for instance uh proceeding of uh food which is well can be collect it by um by following down uh into the central of uh this kind of plant and uh hm this his overlapping structure and uh the flowers they can as well support um would for the sunlight in case if the uh give the leaves um support was supply of water and food
372,1,um i think and i was like to read the animal from written by charge a well since i have already re read the nineteen it for written by judge all well and uh i was um great impressed by his deeper nice this about the you to appeal in a totally litter rain government um also sings trend i is also uh has uh totally to during total little rained comment so i think it the end more on the and more fun could gain me uh more deeper understanding and their i 'd and the opinion towards the chinese comment
373,1,he is are gave he sun get are get a player in the band he thinks he is going to wri ready to con do on concert but the problem is the uh he will he really it will they hear perform the the concert on the campus but it already regio the by someone so he 's he 's wait waiting for the weekend but she the woman think it is hard to to read because so he changed his mind to do on wednesday but the problem is there on small audience on wednesday so
374,1,advi share who um university um walking university uh on time o them uh uh basic information uh on internet or uh other uh root uh um the man uh uh one when the now uh basic information uh and uh there are uh different ways uh and the uh man uh have to s and male were uh ask to advi ch or uh so they can have tree me he get eat uh um he it is uh is really uh to find the information uh about uh s universities program and another information uh sell he is
375,1,i do n't like to have my mobile phone with me at all the time first uh mobile mobile phone is uh is the important was that people communicate with others uh if my parents have some uh emergency emerges in problem like new to talk to me by if i do n't have my phone cell phone with me uh uh it can cause really bad that event and have mobile phone with me also can accent message with friends all the time so we can talk uh talked with friend uh whenever you want
376,1,from the passage we can know that the uh uh the ri writer think the requi requirement of advisor meeting is not necessary of lead the man disagree with the statement for following reasons first he thinks uh the advisor uh have a lot of experience so this will help student to uh to f find to select their cost and find some drops after they graduate uh sector and uh she mention that if student call call to the center that will be we a if they there will be r r way
377,1,uh the problem is that they guy wants to um do a concert before the summer starts but they are auditory it 's of ready booked for every weekend then uh an option is to um to do it on wednesday an another option is to do it on saturday with another band uh i would recommend them to do it on saturday with another band because on wednesday uh the audience will would be very low and they want get the known in they uh school students audience but then in on saturdays they will to play some really good songs and they will be good to be no
378,1,the d okay uh the same a be gi to on the lecture because really di di find a good advice they have time to d and when they want and uh by the said when you 're parts exampled you need but the advice about my uh or dead to d and it use shall hm and save it 's for the bad a bit pay can get buil better because you earn will know to um take time uh first uh uh d d all you do n't have to do some one that that guy made businesses and the guy and it 's better to use the but times uh when they d
379,1,uh for example uh the urn plants uh uh urn plant uh adapted adapt uh adapt to life uh int in the bring free ste uh by using uh water uh by using stored water um you water the uh insects uh very very into water and uh um some nutrients uh store at uh ways the wo with water uh
380,1,i would be interested in reading this book here for the following reasons one i do n't want to know or they posess and the reasons which like the author read this book will just been widely are trying to be in the in the book i want to know about the subject and this taught here is in this class in about eyes one to read it so there will be able to know if it will be of my interest me because for the bad be interesting one might not interesting to the other
381,1,uh dad i'm interesting in reading about been read is the world there 'll hm in when dull it the rest talk about the profession show during the fault i and one man
382,1,in the rain for is taller tree get sunlight and there are a large tree and not set or some plants that they live on has tree to get s apart which they can get sunlight and which uh produce nutritions and uh p did n't uh uh this kind of urn plant he gets its gets its name uh cause is great bowl it creates some all store to store to create a kind of bulb to store water and the leave it 's like it col a cone shape and when the first rain that water is role to the bowl which it gets gets gets stored and under second and then there are some insects and that body that uh can and or
383,1,i would prefer to take my uh cell phone or mobile phone with me at all times uh because uh this is uh uh uh for communicate with uh other friends or my family some mon uh some nice me something emerge shop ported they always talk with me about uh uh the phones to good of they sh an actually uh the help be uh had uh know about every things from other easily and um with the little time actually it is uh ported the take the mobile phone with me because uh it is the one uh uh period special or
384,1,uh the appealing to the cust consumers products container can be designed in two ways one is to designs uh consumer as convenient and user friendly as possible uh uh like uh the bowl on all the wat and another is that the container is designed much more pleasing appearance and uh like a nice box uh good look picture in it and look classic and it so very pleasing for the consumer to buy it
385,1,the urn plant uh they use uh getting used to the in a fo rain forest and he it contains the uh cracks the water and or the in uh like a bowl shaped uh to crack the water to business sing their hire lives and like the epiphytes uh it also to attach to al hos tree in a platform and it ca n't contains the rain water and uh to get uh many there um nutri funs and the uh waters uh from above uh yeah
386,1,uh he do n't agree about the uh about the letter because uh there are two reasons of this uh first of all uh uh website also uh the third also have basic uh base information about uh about graduation but students can get enough information from these uh up but about advisors can get it can it then uh enough information like extra information uh for graduation and second one is that uh he does n't think out and he does n't he did n't think that he did n't think that uh wa think that is a waste of time uh eat this kit uh the time is not in a he can meet and every time so he chain choose
387,1,i prefer to have my cell phone uh with their all times there are two reasons why the first reason is that uh it will be um emergency situation uh for example uh in my mother was sick for uh less tree and if i do n't have mobile fo i do n't go what happened to my mother and another reason is that i can question to another people when i went to the near i do n't know uh how to go to my cousin 's house but i have cell phone but so i call to my parents and i know how to go to there
388,1,given that choice between people have cell phone us at all times and not bring at all times i would choose pre all times i have two reason to support my idea first on it it for my safety when i when i have met some meet some dangerous things uh i have to call someone to help me and the second reason is that they are s operative function in th cell phone i especially is watch for use cell phone for rock j since i do n't have why why sh i usually use my cell phone to
389,1,in the li in forest there are so many tall trees that blocks the night uh to low plants and search plants as adapts piece adapt their lives in the li impresses stay uh complain should or a part of tree uh because they go own bran sh war apart a grea they have unique she when way of the life uh for example the urn plant have do n't do n't will shape did uh pl our uh that can be stored can store water in there and they have one single stem in their flower to uh they deco they nutrients
390,1,the first way to uh appeal the consumers is to making the container user friendly convenient the lecturer gives it gives us example of a ketchup and mustard containers they were first made of glass but the glass containers was unconvenient cost we have to be at the scoop up the remaining remaining contents with a spoon but the flexible plastic containers was convenient to use so it appeal to it attractive many customers and the uh other way to attract uh appeal to consumers is making the company containered looking plea pleasing in appearance uh the example is the making nice containers for cookies
391,1,urn plant one example ap epiph time epiphytes uh they urn tree use other or host trees does support to and to grow in order to get sun enough sunlight and this is what most epiph epiphytes uh do they use host plant to go grow to get sunlight uh urn plants get nutritions from in their leaves where look like up the fi car urn or based of a bowl uh these leaves are used to cracked water uh the t nutritions from box that phone into the le leaves
392,1,i prefer to use or have my cell phone or mobile phone all the times to not to bring them there are several reasons why first of all it is very useful for many cases when i mean is in our life they are uh many emergency situations so at the time we can use cell phones if we have the cell phones um i think it is very helpful for or for or others also i'm are used to having the cell because ad versus i was a little and i 've always bir grow th the hm and use the cell phones uh it is very comfortable for me
393,1,the problem the man problem is that to auditorium is already booked um even so he is practicing it uh fall band there are two solutions for this one of them is to uh play next wednesday um me doing the week uh but the te seem is be uh small audience uh might be disappointing the other solution is to party spent in other band uh that we are playing next weekend and the other band would eat reading to let him prey with them i think uh uh and the second solution is better because i think the uh amount of body seems important and to make
394,1,in my opinion i prefer into bring him cell phone all the time themself because uh it depend the following two reasons the first i can with my friends in touch all the time now way in a different country so bring a cell phone is a good way to make friends and sometimes you cannot said something because you shy but you can send message it by cell phone and secondly if you are in danger you can corn i well one in time and they get help to keep yourself cell ph it uh safe and they your parents can know yourself
395,1,well the man the student great a band and he plays a guitar on it but he will and he wants to show his he is a statement his about this uh uh before the summer but the problem is that uh every every place uh are already e taken form for other crops for other bands to played before summer s all he has a possibility he and his band has a pos have the possibility to uh to play in a in wednesday but he does n't know he do n't really really he does n't know if there is there are going to speak good also he has a possibility to go to play with other group but um uh but i recommend i 've stu i it 's i think that he will play they want they because if with minor audience you can
396,1,oper fly easy kind of and that uses other trees as a flap month web fun for their growth the professor gives an example of urn to friends urn plants uh is is a ha is uh in the shape of a bow bores shape or in cone shape uh the in the arrangement or of the leaves helps the uh to collect water and the store the water uh he also uh in there is a functions for uh uh getting nutrition th because they they nutri issuance just sort in the water the what 's collect cheese it uh as a decomposed uh it has acci kind of nutriti nutrient for a the plant
397,1,in this that uh in this set of material the reading the reading passage describes the concept of warm intelligence and the listening passage is there are lecture bad by the profess on the same topic according to the reading reading passage and uh it 's uh i it it contains the contact double also swarm intelligence and in the listening passage them a professor uh explains that uh sw uh swarm intelli intelligence uh by the example of uh ants when where the ants uh uh take take their food as uh they may uh you read it in a big uh they made up of a group fa and and they take the food uh when i well and they uh cu concise are bridge to to to get the food successfully and uh this is the better than the individual action
398,1,the passage talks sap talks about that the advice for lending the uh books from the library but the woman did n't agree with it reasons as follows first of or she think uh we ca n't we ca n't uh fill the books quickly because uh when we do the paper we will go over again the gain to wri the whole paper and to improve the papers quality second hm there is another way to find the book uh you can you can then the book s rude into like intern library it only takes a feel f days in conclusion i think the woman 's idea was is right
399,1,hm the totally the girl did n't agree we it 's uh that um to change the traditional textbook to electric because text book first of all he she thinks it cost too much too so it 's too expensive and notice in a reading said that it will cause the par twenty dollars turned taught two hundred dollars per day per per they for each time so the girl think and we need and have to buy an new one next time but it need as to secondly she do that and i think it helpful she thinks that something sometimes many people do n't use computers frequently so is not she is a for most of people to read on the internet she thinks the traditional why it 's better
400,1,um thing to the passage the university and announce that uh the graduations and then money will save late to to section fun with the previously is totally one the problems they keep two problems the first problem is because many students further reason years so long time to give the diploma and the woman in the conversation uh disagree disagree with uh this names so the money because it 's long time so so the woman succes to reducing the speeches many peoples speaking and the man uh at that help to uh that uh the speaking is so body and the second problem is the side of the halls so it not enough for the guests of many students and the woman disagree with this again uh that the uh can limit the guest
401,1,um very li city in the ancient roman uh auras located far from and they are small but it developed a larger um because up the uh uh because of the following two with uh examples first years a romans uh and hm large uh build in buil building materials um such as the bridges is speech it 's big enough to transport and uh and the second day as as move fresh clean water and it hard in the mountains to bring the fresh water to to to claim the not that a lot to do deals and uh it 's um uh i think that um it uh uh so so that the city the city in the equipment as large in love
402,1,well swarm intelligence hm means the working seem can help um can help to one thing is that individua can do uh in the listening lecture the professor mainly uh expect is try days uh uh concept the is ways the following uh with the following reas uh following examination uh uh the most uh uh uh ants is a good example the course uh uh each ants can cancer move their food uh so they need that work together so we can say uh usually uh usually there are team of ha is mum bands one by one and then they uh one then they help each other to move the um to move the food that they need um that 's what 's of the um professor met it many uh ex apply in about the swarm intelligent
403,1,frank 's roommate is mu well so he living alone um he can concentrate himself but school is far from his home have um before he live with chain him jim has a car so jim arrive she jim take can to the campus and he cannot afford fi car now she he think he move to dormitory again i think that is the best idea because dormitory is close to the campus and he can spend less money before
404,1,in the reading passage we held learnt about new ca n't greek hold um swarms intelligence um which happens uh uh among and so the involve individuals like uh ants and uh uh something like that and in the listening lecture the professor has introduced two examples and to is illustrated uh about concept the first example just like uh what i say said before ants move together uh to take foods and they may take very high hm have a for the and the then moved moved it to uh to the nest and uh and the second example is that ants also can and pasta food pasta for the one by one just um just one uh one after another and um o only or this examples very
405,1,the woman gives this um this difficult thing um have come and uh have uh come across some give later on time uh old the class and a party um he cant uh take the both of them at one time so um if phone i will the woman uh i will d d area outside take the take the hm class becau them it is n't um i think it is more important than the party uh the woman is a responsible is responsible uh for for the students uh the for the students so um they will be a reading that by the students if he if she miss it
406,1,some people say that the parent should not be involved in oppose imp helping their children to choose a university but i disagree with this they are two reason to support my opinion first of all uh parents uh know about uh the real life and uh they can give a good advice to uh they can they can give a good advice to their children this is good uh choice for their children uh secondly uh ch uh parents should pay cost uh for their child uh if so uh parents uh can uh should parents can should come
407,1,lecture is it 's fit to student uh for like help just fault roommate um but um w he has a problem the problem is coming called much uh the club poss it 's far away from um home uh the woman gives two solutions uh the um two solutions the two solutions are uh using people us or more wait single rooms uh but uh the feet that there is a no busses um uh there there there for their th there
408,1,in my opinion parents should involve the in the process of helping their children to choose a university there are two reasons first is i think pla um pla um parent to have enough experience ants they uh will carry uh we will will cultivate are more situations uh uh in the university for example the um dormitory condition or the uh that the the the professors skill and second is the children i think as not to material love and uh that should their choice may be uh very um purse now purse um because their personality and this is not very uh
409,1,the talk talks about swarm intellige dis uh swarm intelligence uh appears enlarge colonies so uh impor the professor stated example the ants because ants usually live in large uh colonies and and also professor told uh about uh about uh the problem a problem that usually the ants uh uh can uh can cover wrap like uh uh if uh ants uh uh putting for food and uh they use um a problem and uh uh getting the food uh so uh ants can uh connect each other i like or who like stretching uh uh to reach the food and uh it 's like uh uh it is a good examples one origin it 's hard to explain what uh uh it 's it 's really sounds sounds sunlight
410,1,an an work uh and and water cause the smaller uh rocks looks expose into the water and uh we can it can be small cracks cracks become larger and uh uh after and th rocks uh cracks become larger and this uh um the start the gro rocks plant uh grows break down uh plant grows and break down growing over the time it 's can the cost of the hm change changing on them whether eq years and uh the first is uh rocks exposed the second is uh grow uh plant growth plant grows rock expose and rock uh break
411,1,in this set of material wading passage introduce a please bowl which is that some insect species lately word goods um swarms in the lecture the professor use the example stea acts bring these um for example ants and clea colony and they research brid um branch which has a wind stays and when arts works um and branch which had wide space um they connect together so um distances it wing are n't and others is be short will become this shop so they can refer
412,1,individually id did n't tree ie i 'd read the statement that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university there are two reasons why the things so first of all cheer ant down know the details of the university so they done deci where they have to go uh but more dur unre parents take the true other so they think parents have the right we 're children have to go
413,1,the film is the musician is the appear others is the car moon people know is his ge long not uh here by want to present my my uh reasons uh the first one is hm dollar has a uh pu has a major major level uh high level in the play announced i am learn opinion also act so i can so uh he encourage me to uh insist my uh my pm no and doing uh and i will learn eater uh for a long time and the second it and and and uh to and has uh
414,1,the problem of the man the his roommate is is uh going good fa way from i'm and he will be alone and uh he will have difficult to to go to the college because he uh is roommate have uh because to get um ride uh and solution to solve this problem he should move to the campus to have single room uh this will be really save his time and he will go to the come uh the college walking without going like uh of buses and uh the same time uh he will be uh add buyer hm cells to finish his project
415,1,insects movie new ger english grow good songs swarms this of thousands of individual insect they go and star intelligence is a complex group behavior for example ants um if there is a wide space between branches when rock to hold on one branch and next ten hold two first ant and when other whether to hold the second and to connect themselves in the bridge they make bridge between two branches to cross over to reach the food
416,1,i think appo have their own may can chose be written uh they should learn had to makes a choice by themself even they will do some role that it 's a good actually t to learn how to pass a filled parent just compare with uh their children and have solve some such as and tiny then there 's and uh plas their children do their decide cell i think parents should not should not be inve boy dt uh their children to choose uh of university
417,1,the example of the heron university it 's is that that he it use his wing that only for flying can it use his wings like uh protected from bir from the sun when he when it 's fishing uh um that it uh here and puts uh it 's a it 's fewer s above his head above it 's head so to block the sun and that is that example con then then after should books his wings above its hate can see the fish and can cultured and did n't can eat it
418,1,the problem in the english professors one would english professors i were conflict schedule and she have to go to a poetry class at four o'clock tomorrow but she hands also cousin 's her cousin 's retirement party and it will to be very interesting because her cousins more that will give some speech so other english professors said to her he can go to listen inte that of her and i think his could that
419,1,according to the reading the swarm intelligence is the complex behavior in a group them both members the professor illustrates the concept of swarm intelligence the professor gives example uh the ants when they are all was large groups of ants to ru find food uh when um they move together they cross their if one ant ca n't cross a branch they hold own together it 's party and so can they can quarter uh to their have food disconnected
420,1,uh firstly i you like to describe where uh i uh or situation when you can use the rain water um by a feels who have a lot oft is here when use the rain water to cling but feels andy you can sa save marley with these conditions uh teen another way if you t news they recycled paper uh he bec companies or you can printed the material and both sides the you can save money to in this is to reach uh of class to produce paper you need to uh trees and u if you recycle paper you can save the environment to and mo the and same time uh city there is a lot of ways to to save more the in the environment but this is or that
421,1,personally i would like to say that uh has show uh uh uh composer uh so the work i do not admire is uh a man color shock uh uh he is uh a chinese composer and he rock to a lot of of them are songs but uh the first reason i do n't admire is uh is that uh uh his uh i think he is not good at all uh and uh uh he 's sun is just uh uh as the same uh as the s the s the same hm a conf cracked and the second reason is that uh uh sh ch he ch he is uh to to pride of himself and he
422,1,in this lecture the professor introduced uh uh entered those are a serial hard to uh two ways likes can disappear th the first way is if they are and now in love for rains is to um provide waters into than like some lakes so will be this the appeared and the second way is if um people use it over use the water in the like some next now disappear as well one one uh here in the letter writer had uh and uh uh where more uh him
423,1,concept of swarm intelligence is the complexity of society off animal to want to get uh to get the would their work the example from the lecture in that stated to the urn fall finding the food and make the branch together to build up that unhappy ca n't
424,1,the woman 's opinion is tree disagree to where to uh be uh news like tree text book because it 's really reason purse street who worried about cost uh because he just great expanse secondly these uh electric text book is hard to control the because all keypad and monster too small uh ger region is where uh if it breaks wings should why it war more uh had i re well away urn i agree with her opinion because does are treat textbook is expansive band hard to con for her s result i real holy he agree with her opinion
425,1,hm the woman sink the traditional book it cost a last accustom cost a loss and uh electricity book cost of more and so she like the electricity book and uh she think uh it it will be that him to buy too much of the electricity book and also uh well let him cost a lot plan cost more money and that she think very accessible be is too small to find or to prepare uh finally she he build that uh old uh old book make him more comfortable and uh that that is him and the letting and uh he do n't like the lecture the book to highlight and it costly his very uncomfortable and he
426,1,uh the amo did not did not agree with the university 's plan uh university university wants to use electronic bound text book but woman say it text book is more is more easy easy to use because text book is more is its shape and the text book is the more small them electronic text book and text book is it 's more it 's more easy to highlight point and underlying the and the ri design and write winning note so uh so the woman expressed expressed s a text book text book is more if the easy to use for students
427,1,in the lecture the professor explain about swarm intelligent which uh example uh and is uh their call me the first is they move together to to the tree to get the uh to get the branch e and uh uh actually is to get the food and when they reach when they which the tree uh there is a lot uh wide space and not of them are alone to get the food and second is other ant uh d con concrete answer concrete and to reach the food so so they support it 's other to get the food uh together
428,1,in the cast this topic he i think the cho um is uh maybe popular actors whose work i i'm do n't adding years the first because uh this guy i have a lot of money and maybe uh because he 's a role the famous all all the world but he never do nation some money to other people or really need it and the another reason because uh he do some bad behavior of other peoples made week uh some and uh some bad thing like and uh i think that that 's thinks is not a good example of other people would like him so i think and not admire her he 's
429,1,the most dislike person uh i have i ever i wherever had and uh it 's um it 's uh tune young we uh we who it 's that director up uh horrible movie first of all i do n't like to se watch uh the horrible books something like that each very and terrible to see and um and makes me um afraid
430,1,um the swarm intellige intelligent is like doing things together and achieve their go together just like the ants ants move together to to the food source and then when they see uh wide space that um they so that they cannot um go across and it get the food they lay um just no one and hold the and of the age and the stretched his body and others other ants do so and then so that they can reach the the food source easily and in get the food has how they work as a group and then they do things like together to help each other and to fall time and get the food
431,1,in this conversation conversation the woman have are schedule conflict and she do n't know how how to uh to fix to fix it uh the man think seed stick he can help she he can help her by instead buy instead a by instead her by instead her the leg to give a lag to give a lecture and what uh which of so uh now i think the man the man 's recommends is is is useful and uh the woman the appreciate it 's
432,1,uh in musician or artist the and uh buy a both they say about what is because it will present they should have is means they this kinds in style and his physical about the first about weather and like they present they should of the music it will it times and they this uh they all change response to the music it will store create they towards the recre fill the impacts of uh means it find artist what is good to also because there 's not big to meaning cell fish
433,1,only and think uh and you nation i admire most his and a ninety a very famous american get how least um a very good music created by and day it 's called reading um this is uh sound uh and they dedicate uh small grow which is a special friend of he spend it although the school come and went away from this work very fast but and this this music uh help us to remember the school for ever uh from these music hm i can heard uh help me having trouble of this young go uh carefree very uh active and uh uh always have a a lar good time
434,1,the plan is to switch text do an electronic hall electronical device for writing for the administration it is more simply and it will cost less for students however the woman uh does n't like and does n't agree with this plan d form her firstly the hm the price is not realistic even is books are not uh even if the books are not cheap this is not cheap to d tomorrow ver uh students want to to have it with a new features so they have to replace it with the late arrest so it will cost uh also and they
435,1,this fu way it uh he is not in agree with that um the students proposal uh reason in a a letter and uh send to uh a campus uh university infact the uh the woman 's um opinion is that uh the time uh used by uh school um a boy to use a book the dense uh from uh the uh use that both make of the book for exams for researcher uh the boy uh takes a lot of time uh any for to uh gives a the book to the university and then the woman says that it is uh the re is uh uh a univer away top wide uh to waiting uh lot of times to to using the book uh uh using uh device did the not the by the university library
436,1,in the reading passage it 's that uh if uh uh on inse insect to s become in a swarm it can do past that individuals cannot the and the lecture agrees with it and eat it gives uh example of a swarm intelligence it gives is an ant that uh if an ant wants to cross cross the branches then it they will make a bridge to cross the ants make others others to carry the food back to to to de another branch
437,1,uh from just being and then here d clearly uh seems like the the the woman has at the conflict them in say uh he has about of important things to the but he has not choice what to do one is perhaps a retirement pour there are a i hear the the the other uh is a he had she had to teach some sun point courses um the two solutions uh one is the the man the like to take her place to to to give some teaching and so she has she will have to ha have time to attend the retirement retirement party uh the other one is not clear the
438,1,the reading passage explain uh explain the swarm intelligence and it is it 's the con insect um term intelligence they can do that complex a behavior uh the lecture a gave the example of ants ants work together and give the past uh raise the food uh they e walk in a branch is this is uh uh the resourced ways um they their work the op op an and there was have buyed and and uh ant and the ants and any types uh plant and uh and the ants and
439,1,about the the swarm intelligence first of all about swarm need and it means about the when the individual have the simple hard but when once they come by a were uh they can they can meet the the goal one of the ol of the example that uh the lecture there may att is about how the and move from one branch there do n't have food to the brand does n't have food that have food and uh uh the gap between the those band basically it more it it will and from a fight with form a bridge between between the plants so that they other and can move over uh to do the brands and have food so these enough then how swarm intelligence can be a steve by using the do
440,1,the university has a plan to it uh it large the new the why like electronical e book for the new student so that they can use it the why repaired uh the hard copy textbook because it will be cheaper and only one plant pers they have uh the woman it 's greatly me and that she totally disagree with uh this this plan because the partly family is she think that one they they should uh they many factor any well was sir not be really wide people will student and the carton just add up and if the wise book we have to they have to pay upon one the quite at uh and secondly the divides into mall for reduced effectively and the last leave and it 's it 'll comfortable with the old fashioned way so that 's why cities feel it is uh
441,1,the problem is uh she has that double schedule at four o'clock one is the they peop class for the test and the other is uh her cousin retirement party and the solution is uh solution is that he he do the class instead of her or or not class she she or he did n't disa class for for the test and i recommend she feel gives a lecture instead of the her because the student they expected will student uh expect do the review class and the and the why she ca n't the with the class it 's because of her schedule fade
442,1,i disagree uh with parents involved in the process of helping their children to choose university because the children uh the age of the children is already a loaned eighteen was sixty so they could choose though way how to live by themselves and me to invol being to choose university by parents is just in the feeling of what they what the children want to do so uh it 's all
443,1,uh the concept of swarm intelligence and indicates that complex tasks are downs together by the whole swarm uh to reach a goal of to do um uh the things that are not uh uh that uh uh single individual it 's not able to do alone hm uh the the example uh uh in the lecture uh illustrates this conc uh because um the one and will not be able to reach to go uh with the food so they uh um the but the holds the whole swarm of ants um can do it because of the swarm intelligence
444,1,i think conc uh tell in the university they they can switching from traditional bound text books are to electronic uh in attorney textbooks are really need early next year say and the home an express are opinion about university plans say in the lecture and uh and the lecture better te uh be would romans up hm explains uh explains that this a pro uh be uh appro and this uh not is uh uh she uh she would like to partly and he would really like to or chase a new books uh because it 's uh move new books o have many fee uh with with new features looks like comes new fill a new feature said the latest versions uh he ke and uh you can an easy to uh use a that uh if should looks like a pity small uh uh like uh as a it was centimeter said hm in uh in which have uh it keep pay to see uh she could uh note
445,1,according according to the announcement it is uh university decide to change uh uh traditional text books as a uh electronic uh textbook of uh the woman uh other is uh disagree so with the new policy she gives two reason for her opinions one reason is that uh it is very uh expensive if they uh use to to electronic books that they can uh they should spend uh much money so she uh she disagree with the decision another reason is that it is not easy to use of uh electronic text book uh he give month and uh also they cannot uh um on the lines then highlight uh impor important of heart uh of the uh textboo of
446,1,well these uh popular uh possible sport supposed to i do n't admire uh i think is uh um is basketball player it it it it it it
447,1,well i do know disagree this statements first of all i think university that a parent you parents like it maybe you do not like that and she and the children may have a he own had aid own friend he on interesting for these university but he he or her his or her parents do not like that i think children sh she ha around to choose the university he like it maybe f um well maybe he ge parent friend uh he like the major about their major he liked it
448,1,uh f right uh we can get them in order do ideas of doing uh anything invite i am we can gather information it helps to gather information uh they were through the world and we can make we can make a uh we can make about truly in order ideas it is important because it next one person more confident uh toward they dislike the and they he can use his knowledge dro they world uh d and he can be able to a pla uh plate uh in order to ideas he learnt from co
449,1,i agree with statement uh teenagers cause many problem for the parent as a less disagree uh thing uh the statement teenagers cause many problem for the statement but the parent agree because uh many teenagers are are attracted to it the uh that things like the ex uh the ex figure see gas and uh drinking problem there are spoiling their less and making uh he about their parents and i disagree with some children 's liked uh there are developing and many other j thus how in
450,1,hm there are are general situation when uh the university is planning to change state textbooks to electronic books because this play show on s uh carry more advantages uh such as save money or and uh this systems is very simply to operate and in the school sh an the woman um she is does n't like they unive they university idea because she thinks that um is easier uh through week greet up text book because in in this situation ju can underline uh one part of the textbook of these you want to point out of this test is easier done in the uh electronic book and additionally i think that
451,1,any the one that uh the professor has is that she has uh skill do n't prop uh at four o'clock she has her poetry class um it was a review session where she is going to explain um for here uh did outs of the students because the next likes they would have uh a test but at four o'clock ini she was class a party uh her cousin 's retirement party um show so she does not know what to do bad she said he would help help uh with the class that he would teach the poetry class and she says that uh she would uh teach her class and the right late to the to the class i agree one for her for writing late to the class because
452,1,column them passage the text book to offer get like is very is very cost to under in class and he and some of and some of a students uh some of his into things it and uh need uh do n't need it because it and uh uh and go to uh and go to the screen or internet to uh to uh to to uh to uh to get any think you 'll need your normally all you you 'll need you need and in them conversation the woman in the conversation the woman uh talks uh look some out that uh textbooks he is her own and they have the text what is very should because uh more more and uh uh most of uh be students need to needs to
453,1,uh the problems the professors had is um they have uh same time same schedules schedules complex uh at four o'clock there uh first they have a test next week and that to have to review the class and the next one is uh they also have a retirement party is her cousin 's at par part four o'clock um it can be done both so uh the solution is i think the best one is uh they were uh financing should be attending the review class to explain to the students before the test because if it 's fill with other professors
454,1,in my opinion ice hm in my opinion parents sh and not involved in the process helping their children to choose the university firstly children have their own interesting and uh and the station in uh and uh uh well uh they have they are call interesting and idea as uh in uh in making decisions um parents ke parents called gave gave they are children suggestions and adv advertises uh an but he cannot can chore the children 's decision because every will has their own opinion
455,1,i like but the but it is that um actually just so the i watch a movie about to broke it with uh it 's made ste under the smell so calling there are talk to be late uh the house and and the save all their diff give the one of one of people are can uh i think i want to be i can becau uh all the tells want any one force look like that beat but he is uh really really film scary i wish
456,1,nancy have a big has a big problem concern his schedule conflict she has a conflict because she can t is to student in the plant because they have another schedule there but the man like to help uh by help to ru will or to teach the student in stay uh the subject i think about the poetry uh nancy said that she rep a why uh the material but the man said that he will be prepare by himself for my suggestion um the man can held nancy he is very co i and he 's am used uh nancy material duty is student cut it will be the course poin with the she used to
457,1,in um my opinion parents should should be involved in in the process of helping their children uh because uh uh they have a lot of ex by and and i think uh the buying know which a university if the able to uh uh it 's to uh uh be uh very uh uh convenient to to and uh uh their children i think uh it 's one of uh has uh much important to that and uh i can uh imagine uh you when the parents uh uh are speaking to their children and they know uh our than uh uh the are um with the capacity of
458,1,well i think the university professor is the most important job for me while firstly highly educate take hated professor is really can do some research for further studying of our environment or our assigns and the secondly the professor teaches student and they teach them hel to weather of their life and get them highly educate it in th they make contribution to the next generation that 's the reason why i choose university professor think you f f
459,1,the girl food to bus to to see her parents and get back but it 's because of the storm he was supposed to get back last night but she arrive that this late in the early in the morning she was although state but his she still has a presentation in an hour for as history paper that is really bad so i recommend to she re i recommend her to give an explain nations to her teacher to reschedule the presentation and dam a big get for her for a better performance but in she she 's sh due could cha choose the second tress that is grab outcome of coffee and go and working that goal so it it 's just difficult but work thank you
460,1,the swarm intelligence is any it 's um um uh is our group of animal that uh it 's are able to really a ch task that alone can do ca n't reactions for example from from the uh the lecture uh we we and we listen that the ant um uh go to get or to to search food them um week he hm the professor say that uh to reach these uh food that they in the in they encounter uh ups they cause like cons white them uh like what the uh white uh uh bridge uh um with uh with the help of every um s uh one hunt can can react the other uh the part of the bridge and can uh take for the cities important because that um go to go o ingroup pull it 's more important go alone
461,1,as the professor said that one ant cannot reach the branch to another branch that has good on it but in swarm exactly swarm intelligence makes ants available for the complex complex test that avail ap for the complex text dead an individual ant cannot succeed so they could reach the branch with their group the groups help
462,1,well i think uh that and the i do n't like it i do n't like have work is enjo in uh chilly i really do n't uh be admire by hel work uh i agreed impor that and the one of the reason i think uh uh she selfish an is and i see from his uh from from uh from is active patient uh when when when when she go to a the te uh uh act kill all up boy in africa also sm like that he just want to show off nothing not think more and another fee i do n't i do n't think that uh she is reliable uh it his hand held life that 's why i do n't like uh
463,1,three disrupt we read the skill per rese films switch to electronic books her first reason is that it 's only realistics because the letter text book is more expensive than always not text books so another reason is that all does not text books it 's not easy to use because the students to habits conc is to used all does not text books so students game more comfort over using for is n't text book so it to be specific things students time underlying the wise in the text books and the stressing the change king and writing the may most so students they more cop proper they text or is not text books used for these reasons
464,1,uh the university 's plan is to switch the lesson trick electronic text books and use cost student two hundred dollars and the woman says it is not that tow a good idea because it is it cost a much it it cost two hundred dollars and uh although text books it uh no textbooks are cheap the uh new an every year new w uh judge will features appear and it would cost them uh then she thinks it is not easy to use it is only a hundred sent majors and culture botto sep too small for ie for now normal people and uh not good not easy to get the information and she is completely satisfy with new uh her old way uh the study
465,1,the lecturer explains two development that allowed ancient roman cities to expand first it is a concrete and the second it is aqueduct uh first our explain your the concrete and it is it is a p material but it was ad balanced to their uh that was a it is a post building material which can uh you can build uh bridges into the on bridges why because concl is uh tough tough and uh they j uh uh and strong for the water and by building bridges you can create larger or city and aqueduct are is that channel which can bring fresh clean water even though you cannot you do n't live near the river and
466,1,i think they using is my mention his book is favorite library to me hm i think wide whether reason business book is favorite for many children um because um he have a lot of experience and he uh write uh it 's he 's it 's parents for a lot of children um sometimes uh he gives he give me a low i give miss uh a great uh carry take care of it is uh to make uh to do said to do a lot of things and uh he he have he care mea which what we should do and what we should n't do
467,1,i agree with the idea parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university uh first of all i think that hm parents uh who will have to have the and to choose because parents have more uh by it job experience is in the right so it left fooled have fu or for children to choose university uh in terms of choosing the d admire admired rain teacher in picture
468,1,well i agree a little bit but only a because they have more experience so they can help you to choose the best university for you the riv uh it 's uh uh uh but the decision is years uh well of the student so the parents most the parents should uh help people th they do n't sit decide um while also it depends of in my you really want to to do um for the experience i think the do parents should help you in this part
469,1,i agree with this statement because a child has not so much experience to decide himself and the woman himself will which university he has to choose i mean if parents know block better and there would help you to choose university there would set to to like to and that i thinks that uh while uh choosing will solve to and when parents help you to you will better choose universities are to like and uh uh where you can um start they things that you are interested in so i definitely agree with the statement and it would be much greater and they will get greater is n't if parents of a few to choose university uh
470,1,the plan that professor nancy this is that uh her class uh uh class and uh her her cousin retire al a retirement party has uh has a conf slit conflicts uh there were two solutions firstly as some professor carry place came to chill j the class and uh secondly uh uh cra students can prepare the ch asked uh by themselves uh i think the second the second one is better than first one uh um because uh uh this th uh her students uh can s miss the tasks and he also can attend his attend her cousin 's retirement party uh
471,1,the university changed it 's all the uh other policy to the ten to providing text book hm they uh changed their um all the long to the electronic text book they said uh according to the reading passage they said that these uh new no new text book is a uh simple to operate in the future suggest into the the features such as highlighting and note taking and the cannot by the conversation um the woman express his expresses he and her idea uh as of all reason first of all the costs is high because i want time uh usage is uh cost that uh two hundred dollars also it 's a it 's not comfortable beg because uh when they go up from the desk they need to pay ken so if he express is small to her use
472,1,in this set of materials the reading passage describe the swarm in the intelligence and the reading and uh listen conc is the same topic of give by the professor uh in the recently in the listening passage the professor goes on to a dorm because of two a describe re a list um just coup a swarm intelligence with uh wi with one example uh their use that is a the aunt after hm what is best in wo n't all art is best important they can they can finds he can find food oh what career uh and uh he carry for the most one not it he self so uh with the cooperative o on the hm the aunt come carry more more card for them and how to foo the and more that it they get then then they can sub was more uh they have they have a build up uh picked up a a connection to how to friend will and uh or to bridge is
473,1,so um the university wants to go or from um the regular textbooks to electronic text books to the use abou electronic text books instead and um and they think the university that this is um those uh uh more efficient ready uh utilize information uh the uh um and the won term it 's not it 's expensive wasted as uh as uh as uh first pay down or first payment for these devices um um and the the woman in this conversation is um his opposing the change basically with his she uh she 's afraid that um um does but the university 's idea
474,1,uh i agree that the parents she is uh fit it or uh support their children after the after university because and i think the chil the there are some or daughter will not ha will not afford to their all tuition they ha even though they are part they have part time job they will not their the le now uh for to their alteration and i think parents have dv uh but their children child because uh after they can or money they can uh wra fun them
475,1,mar conversation i can environment that is uh there are something warm give the pro professors sk eh chose because his class and his parties time is is coming to get there so the the male professors to chance the team a out professor that he will come to he will come to the class ins that of her and but the woman say it he will th tech the speech for his cousin 's so in my opinion te i preferred the ark melt professors help the woman because is it can it 's more adaptable actor cut the people and and bene fix uh
476,1,university have that around to is to uh elec boring text books uh but uh the woman uh disagree with this plan uh because of two reasons first uh she think uh uh uh it 's takes uh it takes much money uh in the rome could uh uh because uh when the device uh breaks uh they and uh they say uh they uh by and then that device and second thing uh the device is too small to will loo it to use so uh it is difficult to uh function
477,1,it 's a lessons so what the woman problem is that had a a second agreed and he have bought class and party to attend to at the same time the copy cau movies a problem uh she thinks two possible solutions one one is to uh do to go to the class uh instead of the body and another is to let the man cover the class uh the for for her environment and in there and that she should uh let the man cover the class uh for her for ci benefit for first because uh it can educ he she will have time to go to the go to the plan of her retirement party and and she and uh she want message uh d because it is so important that she has a misses what 's before furthermore the man the man how the lend dentures that has uh the to their buying the for if yes so terry appearance d
478,1,the woman expanse her opinion uh uh food student propose that uh she uh a great i to send uh new the student are open later uh because of it uh it but this can music the center old open right um normal time um she pair order that it 's it will influence for uh important her last because a bra alone very and it 's and the man suggest uh support at the woman 's idea he wants something that that is a very good idea and uh he can be he environments and at any uh and he is parent heron also they are how the her some concerned as bringing a winter but the school 's clu to talk good it will know the woman that so
479,1,the univer the universities and it 's cone states him from traditional books to the text books to electronic text early next year and dorm uh uh gain s a parts uh first of all she thinks cost is on one thing because text who 'd are more cheap and secondly it is only have were convenient is not help her because he 's the small and she thinks it 's the for to used time and but more she likes used fans was when the sk helping the so she is against the university 's policy uh
480,1,the professor talking about ants ants move together uh for food source uh some times uh him him he may he meet uh rock um he they uh they met law ke uh they take connected it uh they are s body and another ant uh walk walk walk uh own there is body head and uh so so pass um the uh bridge
481,1,the reading passage or sorry the reasoning passes pu why about to in rese professor to talk about a schedule the female professor worry about schedule time of student key worry about the schedule time and she not musicia l the pop then and the male professor sector is that he choose not worry about this and my opinion the female professor should recommend the student and really i rain schedule uh in proper alre ph
482,1,he the list passage it 's uh truly go sh professor have a core solution the prof uh the professor uh want to uh he she gave cho she can choo go to the the class for her to the class because have a he have uh her cousin party but he he he give hitting stu giving uh class because the next week he she give she she will uh accept class uh their other prof th they did other professor professor st told told another that he can choose to talk giving uh to give it 's class uh she she think is good
483,1,the musician the that was what it 's not ad by by me um is apparently most ot first of all his want does n't really um get that much feeling into um the listener mind which i think well just solve be personally i i think it 's um his music is too happy but in reality um does n't um an in contrast with uh a musician like be told them who ca n't portray gra
484,1,actually the professor has a two appointment in the same time she had uh review session not fall uh th uh four o'clock and she had uh his ca her cousin uh every retirement party so she ca n't he managed to appointment uh she ca n't months to appointment uh i recommend that she can uh gave that the review uh session but at all the uh she might have uh have an hour review session and then she can leave and because to the her uh her cousin uh retirement party uh and she can give uh the student another time to uh to review uh before the exam
485,1,j changes dishes come across and the problem with the for the uh the schedule of the root to and um they have a to plans to go to do wo n't par to home the book to own four o'clock there they he uh she have option fa childre lessen his class but the other one is that other wife they have uh um the he 's she 's cousin 's retire party uh he thing they ca n't she can call the both side of course she ca n't count the both talk both of a comic and she family and no one of them and uh in the male male teacher was it can see the tend say to help i can help you to work on your it 's uh
486,1,there are there are uh once my friend uh univers can said that this is the problem uh uh change in the traditional cost book or to electrici electrical text book uh uh well the woman disagree with this policy you she think uh she has two reasons first um uh by this uh electrical test he 's expensive and eat it to must um uh i did n't uh with me and when company so it can film which is a bird king kinds on listening it an like secondly the camp but over they electrical gets book hm is a too small and the woman feel well on camp the but to use in this with this uh type uh bul um i will can pad uh he he have that is a letter should but for this looking better so that 's why she disagree with this policy
487,1,hm there is a reason artist i do n't like uh uh his it lar act is a musician i is call offered and i do n't like him because of to move to the two reasons and first one is he he makes music for teenagers and his music is really uh only to this uh statement of this public and second second more reason is because he is very loud make a better allows music that 's why you can met in i do n't like him um thbe
488,1,um problem is that this woman professor had are retirement party and hand in class and her ca uh in class and class has a test but day she wants to attend the party retirement party and i recommend that uh uh solution so loose salute solution is uh i would this soup man professor deal this class is test test uh because his retirement pretty is very important for her so if he ca n't do test master he have to do that and this test is not uh this is very good for their has students
489,1,the swarm intelligence uh is a behavior of in inst such as a group this most cos and i'm uh it 's like kinds more current a l move together and it is a complex behavior um likes one do this things firs and another one to the same things like the first one so they can reach the food uh and uh the the behavior is uh very i'm um amazing in the these proud of the swarm intelligence
490,1,he mentioned it is too hard to find the food alone so for example ants uh there are too many pass to find uh food so they ca n't find the food around so they make they make like a bridge each other to find the food uh there is there there is the uh there is there is how their uh how to how they e ridge how they reach the food so this pre their meeting so swarm is kind of
491,1,i agree this statement i agree with this the state a bad because uh f fo uh for me in my parents have the many experiences uh my father had the studying studying abroad so she worry uh i can i can get good uh advice is so uh i want to study english and uh in we should it just she and uh my parents study it uh uh same or uh the pa day but with meant
492,1,uh uh opinion about the changing traditional text book to the electric text um s she does not agree with the plan because the because of two point one it the cost of that and the direct text book and they 'll that it the uh useful less buying usefulness of the device the cost one helped or the text book it it shape what the university will change it way s uh text book uh to a new new one in every year so it with will not be cheap and next it 's sides of device uh it is too small for the normal finger so and it had to uh typing keypad also it cannot not our highlighting and and
493,1,of they in every dislike if people all the people have to come a closer with the work of many art is s musicians her actors a uh any person is uh father funny particular uh think this some likes movies on like musical some like bet things are s catching what i have uh uh my a e uh and musician i do n't like very much is and in the in a musician which is and then as a uh image he should me uh uh i do n't like that his music because uh in and every music he he uh he think it 's self uh uh
494,1,the professor has given the perfect examples of the swarm intelligence uses on study most that a swarm intelligence or uh this is uh good example because just like the swarm intelligence uh ants performs to us good uh uh combine daily e uh combining by combining their at first they at first um that cannot be performed by a single and is good easily be will far of by the competition of money uh ants uh uh that is called uh swarm intelligence uh to reach a certain plant one art a good not or possibly uh cross uh uh that so they all they or hours uh joined together and make a bridge to dan next dor aunt uh which have the food so it is is from that this
495,1,in the lecture the professor into two s through plays uh uh the rapper man 's lot are not ancient roman city to ex herons took expand the first way is the man s city should have hm the great will or for example it hand if would roman city have a question whether and the trees uh and the glass can cool um where the second way is the messaging means a fresh water and the food for example if to roman city an is uh fresh water and food uh the keep whole who 'll wish should uh uh develop so that 's through ways of that development lecture uh of the roman cities
496,1,d d d and do do n't do d d one one to uh do is uh he d do does n't d be uh the do do n't d uh d he doe diary the in the do is he doe depp or d
497,1,okay i am i cannot the net with this statement because i think most of the parents one there i call them maybe babies um to still live in live in the at home uh why the got university especially my mom once you to stay at home um why i uh i will go to the university but i would prefer to go to another uh city um whose how way for my mom but i think is i took her opinion into consideration and she would like me to state on uh
498,1,uh i agree parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university because the parents they have ex they have leave they 'll more life than their children who live just for last then their parents so they they get they need advice t when they choose the better university so
499,1,um the university 's plan in is you 're using the electronic text was instead of the regular textbook because of the more cheap appro a much cheaper price any i'm very su rob will sto suitable when they u use use that and purse the people do n't have to buyed the bo each year in every year in use semester but she 's said that 's not a good that 's not a good ideas for any why because he sh is a reasons that she thought that she as whether to use the highlight appea in that the book to
500,1,the woman 's problem is that she has schedule conference the man the woman discuss two possible solutions the first solution is that of friend cover out class and the second solution is that she cover the class and when to cousin retire party next i think the second solution is better than the first one and uh the first reason is that well the whole friend it is really is to responsibility for her friends to cover her class thank you
501,1,i do n't like the movie adv and have because and have a got uh do the writers name but i do n't like that i do n't like the does move very much even though i but is say that his movies good but i think the story uh this movie is quite empty and his car and he is not school as the directors last the famous movie the tennis pen that i learnt his just have good have good tree the free the has good freed eat but the stories no
502,1,if all most ancient city just very small and just him on one side of the river but the roman they invite some a new concrete that can build in the water so that they longer bridge so they can make the city in both side of the rivers so the cities grow larger and then the second one because they can buy make in the buy new new of things call aque aqueducts aque uh cracked that it can move the water to the cities so so the city can be far away from the the city do n't have to beside the river so they can still get uh fresh water so the city become bigger in a new location and
503,1,on uh on a test uh books may what notice for somebody make some the hour so uh and they the route some house and uh know off the whole to me uh they does uh really difficult the some picked i do n't like it to this field that it experie als on our you and will make they need uh actually is impor so the study what they do some um s they this will make this would be profession that for the that one and he must be have uh uh i label acceptable for the same dislike
504,1,i i 'd think that it is better to the parents should be involved in the process of helping their child to choose a university first of all uh they have a lot of experiments uh to be specific uh depp experience um help to a s people more uh detail advice and second uh they have they can give a good advice from us um me um for example when i go to the college uh they help me to choose uh are to university it will have
505,1,the problem is about uh uh an english stea there is um there is a conversation between uh two english pay two english teachers so um uh one teacher talk about the uh her click uh his clea about uh the bad more uh also has uh us he oscar what 's uh one matter so she told that uh she has many things to do and also on um uh of the school she has also one uh one class tomorrow and the english uh uh the other the other teacher propose to her and to to take her uh students for um to helping uh her stu um and uh the solutions that that i think it 's uh she can managed to have a s
506,1,i would i agreed uh and should eighty bulb in the process of helping their children to choose a university when i was uh ask the student i talk to my further and to choose university he was pay supported because my preferred university whereas the university that uh my firs a graduated uh he had a l information about university such as professor or faster it is and the courses also he doe grand i met their university all of the university in order to get my feeling about do you were right university sucks the his help uh and that the university i wanted to go
507,1,according to according to the lecture uh the professors sing the roma romans uh re largely loo be develop develop the development was about they have advanced building materials like uh concrete which help them to build to have a building a strong buildings doctor and this allows them to have to to build better bridges uh light and to cross the rivers and even this this bridges was very strong the dense transport materials to heavy materials and uh and this allows the romans to to live uh around both sides of the river and the second the second immerse they have is the easy had uh the they can move fresh clean water to the people as they build the educate the educate and this is lie can can turns can turns band a great amount for are too large amount of people
508,1,the lady professor helps many thing to do at the same time she has a class and the party she had to teach the point poetry class and have the party so she cannot decide what to do and uh did the man professor offers to take cover her class so she can go to the party or he rese me the the solution is uh his uh his
509,1,i agree that parents who 's be in role and held that student to shoes i use a list e becau at first people can s apart that student to guide lie that this with cut it 's the suitable for them because the talent has own experie before and so they can hel and and the understand more detail second the pa because the parent is the beauty that list this is that this plant to take cat them that student
510,1,well uh there are uh me uh act to the me disad who uh i do not uh i admire but one of them uh one of the uh the those uh uh artist is uh how i need not agree uh with a major uh art artistic into is my where i did in first of all uh for music uh uh it 's not uh sensed her music that not the limit uh steam it 's mate with me uh the uh or also he uh for music is a popular with many are young that are adapt uh for me uh it for me they could uh uh the does not a problem um of substance are co uh a content contest and secondly the professor is uh it 's not uh is not uh fit it does not people me uh
511,1,i think parents should be involved in the process of helping set children to choose and plasti actually the parent have many experience and have many information so they should at buys do their children the as much as possible to rain cannot the said only by their selves
512,1,from this article i can see that the university is switching to electronic books it changed to electronic books we can down note book uh lect if strongly book is two hundred dollar but we paid if one paid and text book is gradually in created so student will save money in the if rome one uh and electronic books is more help to student um but i
513,1,i think that in our age because various major is difficult to him to find or to choose an university because we did n't and what we would like to uh in the future what kind of the rock vision so parents uh have to to helpers to to far in the or less to find um to to help us because uh we need how parents because they know helps that is why they can help has um even he f would like to go uh for example in the states of america they can find someone to to look attend and
514,1,uh uh school help then about the uh that every students take a new driver and uh can and uh look their book and material in these neutral it 's just cost two hundred dollar and and you can take the high light and the loads her in distract but the two uh two students about the talk talk about the new plan the uh go do n't like the uh bills since because uh even eq stea better uh you know uh during the break you have to buy a new one and uh the man side a lot of people uh uh like a maybe because it 's very much easier the girl say uh of course is easy to use that um the people it too small and uh you know uh it 's uh let her feel uncomfortable to use such or drive they uh she pre still prefer to use the old fashion odor book to uh to like like occur feel comfortable in that way they adapt
515,1,in the let me is two professors to talk and the problem is the woman professor have time i ca n't moved to cities together one is he she will to flying uh his uh her students party in tomorrow and others is too it 's too somethi easy interesting in my agree in i think the professor should do to brand her students party cause it 's two reasons first i think they can she can supposed uh student any important the second the stu students was that will be very happy so that 's not opinion thank you
516,1,the university 's plan is that uh they are going to change the paper text books to electronic uh device that uh the article states that it will be more beneficial to students because it reduces the course of buying new text books because the electronic textbooks cost less expensive and you only need one device but woman state uh woman uh says that the students will like to have the newest the latest uh version of the device and if if the device the breaks uh they will have to buy new one and the articles article says that um it will be more useful but woman say it 's
517,1,two development and li uh that was discussed in the lecture firstly was the beauty concrete underwater where they have to be the special con like to be the special bridge to be able to cross old cities rivers secondly the sep the second development has to do good structures like acquire their whereby they have it brings fresh water for drinking and this do not necess we have to and the the the people does not have told necessary live near a river the acqu either brings a fresh an water to the roman cities and the two development as allow the ancient
518,1,actually uh i would like to talking about person he 's actor and that should i do n't like his work because he talking about some think is uh and uh bad or how can you make the river near first or uh how can new uh it or stake something th you are not allowed to take it in the general so he helps people to help to the evil and de deal things in the war th and these name actually jone he 's actor in uh but it
519,1,the woman and the woman disagrees with this opinion of the university plan because uh the cost of this a device is been more as compared to the textbook the textbooks are available in achieve manner and they are easily available of reading and the we only one device uh easily perfo the total university and in this device he according to her view there are no more futures and this uh device will be again plants plant it or with latest latest devices so this is not beneficial according to whole opinion and preparing for classes is easier with this but the books uh she likes reading because she uh they i there 's a different sections and different points so for her and they are but in this device they have a note also underlining and according to the in my opinion the woman is taught it off using the uh books because in this was the sections or behind it or and we can
520,1,i do n't dying are japanese mission its name is con colder because uh help a teacher is own with load end also her uh also her first lives it not build home had participated he low color can a in the has some many good musician but um she it 's that night see not artist states tested more tell so that the leaf and i do n't like her
521,1,the artist who i to s to talk about is uh the ma she sh and of uh the singer of the group uh contain local uh i i do n't know uh i i do n't like this uh this artist uh because of two reasons fairly firstly because uh he was famous because other other artists uh at this bird people and secondly because uh his songs uh are are personally and day uh dental nothing about anything me in the in uh about problem worms i thing this uh he is not good artist
522,1,d do doe he dull i dull do n't like i do n't like do d d d and do di uh one da d d a some like he d do d d to to d
523,1,uh a task it 's going to be better for the parents uh to be involve in the process of helping their children to choose the university because you know when that 's student done he 's high school so like a teenager can choose uh you know diversity just because he explain chose the same tech but when he is family to help him to choose a university so the spilling to choose the university uh i would they way that he is to that he 's sun well acts cool at the sort a like a chemistry i will do so if the student is good in those subject there are too
524,1,well bust it is tea my city expanded more or than any other just uh because this is a because of two devel about the concrete and uh the way to uh way to move one a own only one is a concrete to used by buildings those strong structure kind of another building which a bridge the when they buy build so strong bridge they can move boss why girl and course in prot pro the paper and that they they have a past way to or move water uh aqueducts they can move fresh water and any others these two to bear about that can improve improve blo by well one cities to expand the
525,1,uh the first development is or resource roman uh that they know how to choose to choose a location and then know how to bill how to build the city also there there helps um a lot cause uh just the they know how to which is build the hard for the uh experiment and uh the second one is they have uh occurred uh uh a crack dark s and others and lessons help them choose uh to fresh waters users for by use rather and were use world very very convenience to use water and the that 's what uh or it fresh uh but other about a people need need to just work hard to get one
526,1,uh the post the lecture and then reading lecture is talking about the swarm intelligence and this reading lecture they give an example it 's one kind of the instead inst pants they translate the informations with and simple active and they will translate their food that uh information to like them reach ness to cross to to each each other the ant and they this is a pour the it 's more grows uh stu to translated information by them some some they connects get the if the whole ca section and they can reach the food to getting and that 's all thank you
527,1,two professor is talking about uh a retirement order lady but the female professor and the rule there and she realize the po tress or class in it 's important and is because some you be retirement for the class and you pay he should want to let something to the roommate mel professor and offer him some who material can prepare for the class and he will review their and an retirement then is a party and you want to to do n't she did n't want to miss it and he will prepare for the party for the retirement that 's two solution about this thank you
528,1,in the le goes of the reading and the listening lecture is talking about that uh id and uh uh a digital text book to to instead of that traditional text books and in the listening room in the listening lecture and the female of student ex disagree with this her to sing bases cause um two hundred dollars is is more expensive and they and they want to replace everyday at the books and prepare the recre uh know you know helpful to easy to use and is is pretty me small and the keypad and the function is not enough um they highlighting is hard to have to use the and and uh the female student think is uncomfortable to this plan that 's all thank you
529,1,the out of uh uh many insect uh make are large group to get to some advantage to live uh live longer or did took se uh some more advantage uh dis called swarm intelligence one good co example is ant uh in the lecture professor show one typical example of ant uh um the situation or uh that and many and are working fall would food or branch uh the branch and uh and uh professor showed a how to across a branch to as a branch uh and inc uh pleads like a bridge by their body
530,1,the passage explain swarm intelligence as limited to litter ad accomplishing some pass easily real in so acts like together they perform some test easily that single insect cannot for example like long yours ants gone over clon the food the problem according to the lecture there are a colony of ant cannot reach uh cutting food search their product a different solution for the problem they create bridges by using them self these edge and hold on to uh content and they create a bridge and another ant cross over the bridge
531,1,roman city is devel and whether country are uh roman city produce soup man equipment to creating lecture city uh gave period they build tress screen what there are in city bu do uh to to make the really far more plea in and they can get uh when what they have to pay thing um drinking so university grow larger than before uh
532,1,d do i d uh the d he he he was a d d d he d d d d d i d d d d d he he the or or i do i do n't i do n't do d d a oh he he well d d d
533,1,there are two major development uh in ancient roman cities they uh advanced building a marketing he halls such as concrete and to operate they finish clean water uh such as aqueducts the first point the made it possible to the build a new building sep ch as a building up bridge and uh it made possible to people course through the uh and call all but go a close uh read appre better the second in the uh the second point uh is also how her aqueducts it male imprint or simple for uh the possible to uh grow the city that she a in a new editions their s about
534,1,according to the conversation the woman is in trouble because uh he is important class and uh uh retirement party is conflict so the man gives solution and first solution in s he cover class for her and second solution is play follow it time and party if i were in this situation i i i will fee for for the man to cover class for for her because if he lied early time retirement party it will below their for the to miss just spee ci of the retirement party
535,1,the university is they can the plan switching the traditional bound textbooks good one text books and the the woman the woman does n't like the idea of the school for the following two reasons first it is very expensive because when i bought in text book and i have to use his my by per colder to could could could good semester in after even united net and then because and second and uh dt disagreeing on the books in any only only books uh what it small it 's very difficult uh to put in touch the small the screens so d d d d d d d d d d
536,1,uh the the university 's plan is to replace the old text system uh with the uh the modern electronic system uh the university i mean uh she uh with with at the effective way but according to the woman their system is costly i mean it it it it some it 's cost a lot of money and then uh compa compared with the text books i mean textbooks it is easy to use compared to the electronic text p system another thing is that uh it is not if if the electronic device breaks it 's expensive to replace it another another
537,1,a prefer is the professor uh explain to the develop common they has allowed uh send roman cities to expand the first one is the tec knowledge uh the professor said the uh low man chan ch they build a match real uh example for example uh they build strong bridge they can cross water uh recyc one is uh the ro man s move clean water to la city uh it 's a special skill called a kind uh the s the skill can bring fresh water uh to the cities even the city not uh close to the refer so
538,1,one of the nee developed development and the allow fish uh she have a month city choice problem is they are i 'd phones building materials the and sick call is there are the ability to it 's to choose but what uh to each and every colder that they will money it higher so that they wo n't be moving to the river to get water that in the the the advance building material they have very i can search worried uh i love their it to stay notes and uh to stand the test of to
539,1,well the swarm intelligence it 's basically means that uh insect it from the group is more smarter more smart it then the insect individual while so from the lecture the professor suggest the great example of ants in colony because this answer amazing when they want to find the food and as a large number of a group of ants go to own a bring brand ci to the food and when they find obstacle like a big space between the branch tree and then one ant and the several and s a connect their bodies together to their forward to branch or make bridge and so bad the next ant can cross the bridge uh actually it 's that ant body but they can cross the work and then they can find the food so these are the amazing example of the swarm intelligence the shows that group uh insect from the group is actually slight smarter than individual insect
540,1,students re using electronic device for their school life first reason she think this is that the problem of cost the cost fill purchasing the electronic books are not realistic because it is expensive and she think stud it is more cheaper it is cheaper uh buying the text book and second if if uh electronic text and grow rock be they have they have to purchase the new one um because uh electronic device is shops uh are not good for uh for the customers so i just version here in the by year so is because th more you to buy it
541,1,i think parents should not uh environme in the helping their children to choose a you the f rusty because when the children is about the he key years so they are uh they have enough more ch or to decide what they cannot do in the film and the he is they are going to they are caught doubt to find their interesting in the fil of starting uh they are got that no while they got not work or while gather to in the future so all the decides deep in order to dra buyed itself
542,1,according the to the reading passing the the university wants to use the traditional bound text books to ten the old text books in future uh in the listening passage the girl really disagreed idea from school she think it is really expensive if you if s will tend clear you know born by hours uh text books and most of student cannot use one uh one text want to they not today if you know bound text books of how the whole every year university use for some of them have to fix a cannot use they have to pay much money too much money for two changes tended of fixed it and the she think uh uh the traditional bound uh text books is not easy to use because it is really small uh so uh she really disagree the idea from the school
543,1,michael that 's because i do n't is n't a ride with these style to the music and i do not admire is he the suns um i think because i prefer the great music it 's only freedom style not that kind of of the pop music f are f or
544,1,i want to about an actor or the uh there would thing in his like the my country that uh why it with me admire his work she think she is finding but he is not and uh uh although a lot of people like sh i am but the quality of work that he you do does n't such by lot of them and it 's many complain that he does not go s books will as have

556,1,i thing advertisement for can engine food is do n't care about pr attacked pro about protecting the hel so we on children because children how they are pro parent see can teach the children to note is this food very often old man that less their children do n't approach this food and i think there are many on people or like teenagers see a like this food and uh if if they is it ca n't uh cause they are pro uh it it cl
557,1,passage is about music with building will be open later and the woman expresses her opinion that he he like he is opinion this uh first is that she thinks they are was too noisy in the future in the past so it can be helpful to ba in the uh second reason is that the woman said uh she ca n't practiced during dor construct well because always dull room music room was booked these are the reason she gives that she does n't she agrees
558,1,well i think it 's necessary to um to to prey into band there can and campus should um advertisement showing on tv because um for your phone reasons first of all you know children has too small to have a spate it is this great rather wrong they of all is discu and information is is it will is they just is world is the information and if you device you know the advi uh th eyes when i also effective so the people will also to buy some is is can e and dorm food um and also this kind of uh need too much uh kind it down ca n't to hardly sick nice so it 's hm not only better for the mind but all the or the body
559,1,material we know that there is the proposal of the student all getting the music a building uh new they building opened later and the woman in the lecture it 's very it 's very satisfied with the proposal firstly she think that if they talk to talk to the uh beauty building to go go to the top uh they will stay in the talk room practice music and it is very good for the student and it is very bad for the student to city and uh d her of the city uh disturb the screen he people and uh uh d one a giving in the given the the uh this will or environment to study and the second he think that he think that it is uh very fall practiced uh with their with that the screen and uh uh with that experience uh d a concert he she think that it will make uh week they it will uh be agree dairy helpful further d
560,1,in this listening material the man has a problem about when to hand hm his article the uh they are talking about two suggestions my his to finish it later and uh the second is to hand on to another one but as far as i'm custard this better to choose force one because he has long time to prepare and bill finish it better and the second uh is is in long time to to um play some other materials and uh this will come late it very well that 's all
561,1,the man has a problem with article he has to put it and to the school newspaper because he has to inter every with director but she is ketchup called now so the woman suggest did two options for that the man has a two options for that and one is for to wait her until she gets over and second one is interview with another actor i i would suggest him to interview with actor because he can put an i copy for the play begins and also he can make an in the view later when the director get over later so i would recommend there interviewing web after instead of the director
562,1,obliviously the woman in the conversation lees that remove old bicycle from campus rocks is a good idea she has several reasons for that first of all she mentions that many people ca n't find their messing bike if people river moved the old bicycle from campus rocks and besides she also pointed out hm others will have more fully space in addition she think she could have most pace to walk if s grow remove all bicycle from campus rocks so that 's all the reasons the woman agree with display
563,1,the problem the speakers are discussing is and the woman could n't wait experience um uh she ha uh she had to um take the take uh pick early early placed uh flight to stay his parents so she worries so she was so excited and could n't flag last night and the today she has uh he story uh plays a presentation um she shape prepare at why uh well but uh she was tear to uh and to chose tire to uh pre present hated um the uh i think and she has to um talk uh he taught her professor professor to put it off and um the professor will and uh and student her and the letter
564,1,i agree with the statement protect the has the young children advertisement for can the ant job they should not be should n't televisions rest ever uh since students spend most of their time time to watching tv but so it affected it affected on their perspectives a lot so it it if students watch watch should watch the can he and john food a lot in the in the advertise brian they can they can want to it it 's uh so much and they make them uh keep uh not for
565,1,in the advertisement uh the woman is uh cooking uh with the help of uh a particular compli is parts and uh plants uh due to things are more expensive than the other products uh doing uh uh when she went to lend she went to the market and uh so other products uh o of ada product part time apart and plant uh he realize that their uh the price i 've uh the particular become a particular the compli was more expensive than the others but uh after that uh she uh she she glad to a new that uh the uh this product such also providing the lecturer uh lifetime policy and uh extra go to uh the woman realize that extra got very word while as uh and uh they actually saves the money by upper writing this policy d

571,1,the business textbook told us new way to to do advertisement by we fade and persuade firstly the company just tell us that this advan testament days uh the ant uh she 's and then to has advantages uh in tell people how to avoid the drawbacks the example the like picture told us it 's there is a when oh company who which produced part part and pants plant th th in the cook tell us firstly the famous could tell us the par and plants are expensive and cause a lot more than other plants and secondly than new cooks do n't want to spend a lot of money on it because there is some uh a lot more shape once in the supermarket but then she tell us uh advantages with which is was more in saving a long term in the allow
572,1,well in the uh listening material i well in the listening material and they are is announce about uh to remove the school want to remove and all the classical uh for compa space and uh the woman agree uh is the the woman hold uh positive uh attitude toward this announcement and first she think uh to clean up these old bicycle can free of the space uh for the people who need a space to uh solve their course or passa cause and then and uh what if i was second and the second one is uh someone is really need the space uh to store of the passa goes uh well av available space to store and the school can given information about clean up
573,1,the woman has the man uh they article that he wants writing but he had a problem because the person that he was going to interview the director of the play is sick so he can interview so he had to different solution for that problem to wait for her to get better bad he will he one d be on time to give to get their article or to interview an actor my advice to him is to interview an actor because in that way he could have the article before the play option and he could change a little bit d
574,1,i agree to this opinion uh i heard all such metal uh before uh in the internet come air american very can company uh decided to stop are about times meant for can the end sh and fooled wish her because key keep the children health good uh i i understand the company want to our money but

576,1,in my opinion i would choose the university professor asked my careers there are some reasons the first is that i can always in on the te have all the word new on the most new things over the world the fascinating of science and are deep into the knowledge of the suns also we can many new things fall uh future human beings and then may not be always useful but it will always probably be good for humans and that the way that the university prepared they can do for all their humor
577,1,uh the color ad greed uh completely agreed uh two reason is that campus newspaper risk stated uh first she think hm the campus construction uh uh into fired there a study um for example last e year uh she was uh very are normally it to uh bec because she can find the par teen lat she think hm because uh the construction there was um no enough part a lot uh secondly uh she think she think the construction should be end did quickly um last year because of the smell uh the construction was the lateness so it uh continue to for one or two weeks
578,1,uh i prefer to study in base where the one of people around i have two reasons for this first uh if there are many people when i'm studying it 's very um um noisy and they ca n't concentrate on studying so it is better to uh is to study in quiet place and um if the other uh are not studying or uh or there just thing um your concentration to studying will be listening listening if you see them that 's the reason
579,1,the benefits of it uh sub surface smoke motion is uh first is decrease impor uh exposure to weather and second is help to a capture the prey and skill that uh the letter to just worked place to pay place very quickly under service is a good example ants uh the first benefits that uh they put very quickly and it 's uh in this way uh they well off boys s them uh the bad uh bad he 'd it uh whether on the sto base and uh uh a boy should be he upward to the parent and the second because um if they uh wednesday uh walk to place to put place very quickly under service they 've catch the inside because the uh insects libra racial well well be touch bet by them so that 's the uh this uh should uh two benefits of service local ocean
580,1,well actors room choose to to study well one option is um studying appropriate process like may many people around and another option is and sitting at uh uh and there in the room like alone or on your plas her choose them setting around and addicted why because um hm uh i could concert either paul press it 's them explain so many virus people so or like can student ol babies so it could be uh in the my consideration the second uh a could save some money because um i do n't need to pay a computers to book pour his his d

582,1,letter about that they moving although plastic call from campus lect the woman agree with this letter because when she is going timing a whole she every time a cost to campus because she did n't find free space to walk to go to tiny home and she complain the campus to they did n't not make and to restrict or school and she mention d pass is have to him i would bicycle because it makes pre had to space for students it

586,1,um so the woman in the lecture agree with the statement um which uh which uh the uh a student 's letter of the uh also uh uh in front of the lecture uh and uh she she um she really get be uh gives us uh to uh i instance uh first is um uh uh she said uh many students need uh uh to apart their class in the uh in the schools so uh and uh and the party uh and the part is not uh is not enough uh be so uh the uh the school uh uh she to uh a fix uh to built more part in place and many student they because uh they they can following a packing places so um and second needs

588,1,from the female is that she just guy she she just arrive the you know u university she choosing and she has a presentation like one hour later and because there is the the weather p s problem she cust taught in the air or poured important like all night loan and she just ri in the morning um the man the male get uh uh suggestion for telling the pos for for professor the situation she deal ways and in order to that the professors fine another day for a presentation but and i prefer to uh females suggested uh solution to get couple of coffee do and she has one order to prepare and since she has had bring preparing for the presentation for a long time so
589,1,about uh friend it it is have big situation about the problems without the next contraction the good be at summer time about this situation the woman uh agree with this idea because she believe that it 's a good idea to uh to build best place to find a good place to park so uh uh the second reason that she provide is because during they lasted year to in this plan uh she so there was a big problem with this kind of construction because many of the probably was about the but uh weather uh some uh starts now p so that she agree with he is a new propose uh the way to create these uh to do this campus cause to him at summer time so she agree with these
590,1,i disagree that parents should be or involve in the process of helping their children to choose a career there are two reason that i want to talk about first reason is uh the children has to choose their own ways that they want to do with their their greedy so that uh when when they ger care uh there are interested and secondly uh the parents are always want to have a job that they are another money because to s birds the uh family in their house uh these are the reason that uh they should not uh involve to uh process of choosing a caring years of their children tec

593,1,i i prefers to study in plast where they are few other more people around because the first one i think if there is can more can make more concentrate uh for study uh because if we want to study we must to phone calls with the lessons uh and the second reasons uh if we have more concentrate with our a with the around place we ca n't get uh the uh result the but she sort of uh examine is an examples off like that and
594,1,the girl just can back from pasta kn this morning uh pass um her schedule she is suppose the to arrive here lesson night but uh due to the that the better whether there is that the lay of the flight so sh she arrive this morning and uh she had she has a an presentation this morning an hour letter from now and that she is exhausted and from this conversation there are two solutions first the uh she go to see the professor and uh ask or to reschedule her presentation but the girl is reluctant to to do so because she still has and not of work to do and another solution is to simply have a couple coffee and uh uh pla uh and uh uh just a finish her presentation
595,1,the proposal expressed the student uh on the num by the newspa to the newspaper that states that the work should go on and someone rather than another cases and they should also would not be too long and uh the stu students discussing from hm in the lecture can be from that can it can be made out that the student is ford it as the proposal would the save a lot of time and it would the construction the work would the be completed early or the reason she gives for holding that opinion is that that uh there is there is she waste a lot of time on packing lot last time when the work was going on and uh she just wishes that the were could go on the summer rather than in the when the where jam possibilities of source dorms
596,1,this set of materials the reading passage describes about the intelligen emotion intelligence and in the reading passage is to that emotion intelligence is the concept that concur at the emotion uh and it helps people time um each have conical no one is necessa to concl and it also uh helps uh um for the good relationship with the society and uh friends and the lecture um and in the hm the lecture um propose two examples to illustrate in the um emotion intelligence and first of all is that his um daughter and per um was watching in the movie in a tv and uh a good actually back to the set of that um more they should hm what uh i'm but then then uh he um and get in uh social work in a somewhat a school with his student kids and i think that it 's a good idea idea and they can they can con cool uh the emotion and then the hm meet with her friend and the indeed oppose this is what is behavior

599,1,the example that had been mentioned by as i college ie professor uh illustrate the concept of emotional intelligence appropriately um for example when he mentioned that his store was upset when his or her friend kim came up with different idea of watching the same movie and she got upset than she think she think why she was upset and the concept of emotional intelligence is mainly people should have to be emotional intelligent because this is will help them to understand people in a proper way and do not take uh this advantage use of other opinion 's so that people should have emotional intelligence of other point of view
600,1,the speakers are discussed the problem of that 's e mail because she uh she wo she uh she was an a weekend and she travel to both done and she is coming bad the tough filled and her flight was the late for seven hours and uh she she was waiting in the air bought at uh the whole night within for her flight and she just take an up and the second day she has a numbers they sh an for uh history class and he have to make a presentation just for th it means uh the uh classmate then they will ask a lot of question they referred they propose two solution the man said she had to talk to her professor and may be transfe air had been they sh into another day but the female said maybe she can take uh traffi and she uh she can focus and just uh finish her presentation i think i prefers she must of pay professor and she will post when have presentation

607,1,for my point of view parents should involve the process of helping their children to choose a career because they have experience they can get it by s hm which so out a good uh way you can on money on way you have a possibility to get it drop but i think it 's just and uh different uh especially point because if um the main a opportunity in the main choice should peop either each a green on their own because they have to live their life and they must have fun with that jobs and they must enjoy that shops than choose it on their own
608,1,i think parents should n't be involved in the process of helping their should n't as they has more experiences and uh and more familiar with uh with those things uh while the why sh and then do n't know what to choose cause they has the uh bit explains with this with their career and the real uh and uh should uh life
609,1,i think the most important cared to correct way stake about good ever hold is um uh it 's uh uh i uh is he uh is the friend friendly uh and and do n't make a show mining noise this and uh if we 're if i need some help uh he ca n't human hand and um we can s s

611,1,in the lecture the professor uh provide to benefit the benefits of the low a self surface look motion uh the first one is it can minimize the change of temperature and uh it is a good way to s the wife for the uh for the for the leaves are th uh in sarah uh because the leaves are can move on another send quickly and it will be very dangerous on the in the s in the exposure of the hide temperature and the second it 's it is a good way to capture the catch it pre uh also usely is or there 's an example it can catch the ketchup pre by the why be re sh and on the surface the he come out to the come out the surface an kept ketchu carried prey it is very good way to do so and it is very successful so you can surviving this way and the live better
612,1,uh from the passage we can learn that emotion knowing intelligence his ability that uh uh is ability to reckon nice to feeling and understand the course sing of them and the lecture in the lecture the professor provide uh provide an example of that she her pay uh her daughter has an na arguments with his friends where he uh with her friend with when they are watching o uh when they are watching the movie she find uh she find her very assets bec course uh she fa i support her very access and then she find a course becau re she she 's worry about the summer job his care his caring at the children whether like her and the friend and and then she tells her tell her friend then her friend that tell terry tell her that you do very very good in do very well in this in the summer jobs so he feel better uh
613,1,the university uh co hm letters the is the campus campus construct some project helped to that you will some uh the woman thinks this is the uh with this distant then or to to a little for the for two reason is true of the one want or cracked they they uh the campus so the practical stored rock so do n't one thing so these protect it happened calm and another reason is uh woman is thinks th are works and the trying to get uh thinks home
614,1,uh so she will have a proper this problem is uh she uh go to to movies theater with the friends uh hurt by a need i were portter amy is late and she uh do n't have a respond well by buyer of my so some learnt pair learn man and woman is jus cost uh two solutions one solution is sh uh the she live lead to meet have live to meet namely so how impor she need to do a movie sear and another solution is she lead the pe with made the boys man uh um live uh the cone nicer hold with about me and so i think the second solution is better first which this is because
615,1,if friend of mine would ask me uh an advice about all which plays choose to live i would advise him uh to look close the at a position old for uh the place is it 's city or or country and then uh the cost of the house or the flat he would choose because the cost is one of their most important things and so uh i would advice him uh to look it position and they cost all the house a flat
616,1,in the listening page the professor exp less the benefit of sub surface motion uh the professor mentioned all leaves that live in uh there is hers to uh explain how uh those benefit of sap surface motion first of all uh sub surface motion can prevent animals to expose to cold or hot temperature take that these are as an example business that can uh move sap surface motion so they do not need to explode to very hot temperature uh second s the sub surf surface motion also help for uh for animal to touch prey uh take the uh these uh for this that for example and uh the leaves that moved in very sep th of the by br a sche an and they move very quickly and day and their pop up and harsh insect as a food
617,1,well i do n't agree parent involve too much um children 's decision i think children have their own interest and their own opinion what will suggest them to talk about their own will if parents involve too much um the process of helping children choose a korea children will fear to expressed are all opinion that it will have a bad influence to their development of their characteristics d also at the school it for lack children to choose their own korea because it will help children to i develop a good had that and
618,1,uh the professor uh so the example of he 's there with the other uh in that he 's uh have to move fact invent job had to look for a time and she was getting of that because she was f she garden though she did not go out so uh ch f or she bec a it 's getting uh dead leaves helps by the go to it would be uh thin they none which will be to watch she can also at the but she where on that and she apple died so any problem he uh f so the exact but it is with the concept of emotion by intelligent in the way that fe fe or i will innovation can need have to think fi
619,1,rev from the conversation i can know the would know what to go to see the film with her friends once she has a headache ways uh waiting his uh friends who later for fifteen minute shop or not and the woman the man give her two solutions the first one is uh go by herself and did n't tell her friends uh the second is cave uh live a voice mails to the wo n't to the to her friends and then go go uh go to see go to sear ger and so in my opinion and from my personal experience are totally agree with woman to uh go by herself the christian uh her friend 's have later for nearly twenty minutes and if and she never response the woman start task uh messages ot calling so i think uh she woman should go first by herself uh because of film will become uh into in in ten minutes so this is my advices
620,1,the problem in that the as she had an appointment with is best friend to go to the movie but uh uh a friend has n't complete uh uh possible solution is that the weather uh as she caused by herself or uh who wait for ten more minute and uh if i ver is if i ever uh stu she i were her uh i with wait uh for my friend from my friend uh tem more and minute uh because uh hm uh she is a best friend um me and besides uh it 's not a big the hm the miss their fast part of any movies so uh i definitely recommend uh to wait uh tem more many it
621,1,they rational intelligence helps it borrow to behave appropriate re uh for example professors are that article is uh have friend his about what movie show they watch they use uh they are they were earning so she was reading acts it but finally she found out uh the reasons of uh uh uh being upset it 's not because uh the differences op uh uh water the profess between the movies were uh they will have breath the reason is because of the movie not because the movies but because of uh the studying s she sh she her new ger and after that they stopped i am went and a project in
622,1,i think the most important characteristic probably letter wrote he is that he is friendly for example i have i have uh invi would quits very friendly and awful invite they to their whole and he has proc with his friends and then i could n't band lead how many people there and i experience really find time so i think the friendly is the best in club point
623,1,the professor is discussing about the two advantage their selves sep sir face local motion the first one involves the animals more and that the under the surface then they enables the minimum extinct them body just they uh should not exp exposed to me mom extinct them but it it for example lead that they should not they are not exposed to minimum extinct them but it uh the second one has take they are uh they cannot capture by other animals t choose for to them and they will protect themselves in this way the professor is discussing about the two advantage or selves sub surface local motion
624,1,the woman 's problem is that she is unable to decide to group room will be without losing the first first the but the man gives that two solutions to resolve the problem the first two solution is she has to grow at self without have frien and the second solution is let high another let another group with the about in the movie i would prefer uh list lead grow uh have with on without waiting for her friend because the movie uh the letter real discuss the same topic in the next to class if she misses she cannot are the understanding the class and she may there is the problems uh well in the exams so she has to grow have cell phone without uh friend
625,1,the less think about the idea that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose korea active it 's uh this idea parents should advice to their children because students about but experience about should in the carry and dv experience also children need to know about what they did n't know about be import by their working environment but the talent have to be careful about not in forcing children to choose korea
626,1,i think the important uh character rese take of occur never heard as uh is that they can ha uh helped or help others um where you have a ch have all you ca n't find uh uh some uh friends that 's uh really far for use so you can fight enable who to help you and s of the problem you will be uh happy and the cool the relationship with others that is um that is the most important characteristic of a good never her would hm
627,1,the reading passage tells a specific call treat heron of uh emotional intelligence uh which can which which uh which which can which means bill can f you can better can show the emotional response uh um uh the professor gives an example to illustrate uh the daughter um do n't know uh why announce go is so said um use uh use few stressed and and and she want to uh to to to she do n't know how to good to choose which movie to um which with her and the finally she knows and that go prob met that cause problem is summer job and uh finally she uh set sorry to that it was that go
628,1,the professor gave an example from the lesser um for example of the animal that um living can work uh underground um she gave two benefits from sub surface look i'm nation the first one is the animal can um keep their temperature because some places very it some place ha um have um extreme temperatures such as um in their thirt it 's very hard so when they can stay underground they can give their but temperature the second one is uh they can give to the pre um surprising lead to the to the are animals uh they can catch like insects hm that they insects cannot seeing them so cannot see them so her
629,1,the student for this at the construction work should tech uh of i 'd during their some hard it is the reason being that the construction uh it to this of destruction have cause uh in case when they 're constructing is or taught a lot of destruction in the camp on and also the student also proposes that the the weather is very conducive during the summer breaks and the woman acts process support for the students opinion in that for example she suggest that she other art of problem in getting the packing not incase when they 're doing repaired and give an example and she had cool color from the talking not the classroom and got they are date and sometimes she event see that the professor art it for the lectures he proposes that she projector they there is a complex
630,2,the man will is play do the in a band to the guitar and they are practice sick for uh some months uh and uh they have prepared for a concert uh which they want to give for then the next weeks before the summer is is timing and they want to perform their recall said to the campus auditorium but there is a problem it is book to the the next few weeks and uh there is a solution for the wi for wednesday night uh for the wasting night these a problem they can be smaller audience then the saturday uh but he has a friend who won the concept on uh perform on saturday uh next saturday and they uh ask them to perform which them uh hm but for a short period of time i will choose the to perform on saturday because they will have more audience and they can s that can be uh uh heard and
631,2,okay it 's a tough as sh in to answer but they will like to have my cell phone all the time because of the following reasons first of all you know i'm a doctor so and as a doctor i should always be every little to make patients or the hospital any doubts because should easily find when they need in addition uh we do n't know what can happen for you when your outside all your instru it and in in the sun in their conc situation it could be better for you to have your cell phone pitt you i had this explains i think it was two years ago my call was broken uh at this wait so when i had the my cell phone with me so i could easy the con the call nine one one and i got help from them so because of this reason i like to have my cell phone
632,2,uh i prefer not to bring or my cell phone or mobile phone uh everywhere um because uh in hm you know um i my what in the uh it could generous and i i often go all the lot other go on a business trip by the in any time i going to phone on with a phone call from our fees or the from my client uh i uh without expectation and uh and this times uh every time i confuse a lot because that i have uh my oh are split schedule in the appointment so that research a or cell phone uh there is not uh confuse uh coffee is in a task so they uh i can be refreshed and uh concentrate or my task only and addition to that in the vacation uh without the cell phone i really food it if less so there are i prefer not bring other cell phone or mobile with everywhere
633,2,other uh if it 's uh fight the uh other of or a rain forest and uh a lot of the rain forest and are the high part is a difficulty uh easy to get the sunlight mother the war but is a go to get sunlight and the professor uh using the urn plant and as a example in them to may should uh to to points of the adapted way the first one is uh the urn plant has unique shape early and their leaves also and the reads us saves like uh a col in a funnel saves in the speak speak give weeks so that uh uh it 's easier to uh get the sunlights are uh in the in the protect the water in the shade also the second one is a using their uh uh plant and uh insects and they are in that and uh this uh helps of them are the store the uh nutrients and uh big the more and uh uh using that fro other uh rain uh urn plants i can get the nutrients from the war broad so the other these other uh if after the man 's of the uh urn plant
634,2,like some people may not to bring their cell or mobile phone with them all the times but i prefer not to go shop the main reason for that is destruction passes destruction in any form of life that this studies uh given when we are working the next thing is writing we cannot use cell phone it is very it is waiting monday to pl not to use it from while timing because it causes accidents and the last thing is it 's points relationship with others that is when you 're in a cinema how if it formed it 's it is a nuisance
635,2,the letter states that there is no use of meeting with the comes that has the university website he save it and that is one more point the letter states it it has blocked of her that when we should should would uh meeting with their university consu the man expresses his idea about the letter stating that the university website is of no use as the counselor is always of fish to help and it and the conc the provides a lot of classes watch should be taken and and they could with extra information and the man also expresses of the second cause that is the her does is that there is no use of reading till the last day of admissions if you go friend it is like first come for so bases and hence there is a lot afri plain of for the concert also for the first few days
636,2,a book i 've never read as rome nutrient by where shakespear but i'm very interesting and really ke uh because hm cancel the worked literature and this often quoted and id life on films i watch so i think this book would have uh then ch for me which would fit and every life so i think the same a famous book this uh will feature read some um i think moreover i will to read the because um i'm really interested in love stories and the town rock trend john room of this book is water read and they are the two
637,2,he plays guitar in a band and they decide to give a concert but the problem is that the old to remain their campus his booked for the saturday night and the other band display they play rock a rock and roll uh the decide to give a concert on wednesday but the other problem for rain says concert is that will told him which is booked for wednesday is too small uh but then they they talk to the other members they they talk to the members of the other band uh they ask them if they could lect them play all saturday and uh keep and he cancel them cancel their uh a concert to another date uh they accepted that uh so they are going to play they 'd so they are going to give concert on saturday uh as it was uh plan before
638,2,um actually i i 'd like to bring the cell phone with um hm me all the time because firstly it 's very convenience if hm i have some if i want to find some people needed day i can call than or if something um accidents happened i can call ni one one or other or people they can help me and secondly um uh it 's a very uh and secondly it now cell phone it with a lot of um uh you can find a lot eq uh of informations use your phone like you can use trip e asked are you can um um chat with somebody online
639,2,the woman talked about the business for selling the products the customers by not only the product but with the containers so the design is really important and the want wait that a products container can be designed to appeal to customers is plastic the product container is really come opinion th much more than glass it 's easier to hold and the second way is the box for the cookies the nice metal box will be really good with the beautiful pictures and it looks nice so it will be more appealing to consumers to buy the product
640,2,the proposal that on the letter purposes say that uh there is no more uh there is no a need uh of there 's no when need of meeting offering the meetings with advisors and uh regarding about the classes that you can take because all the classes a filled was a already um be are already uh and you can seed on the website and the school website ants bec so you can save yourself from uh the difficulties of having to schedule a meeting with your advisors but the man did n't agree with the letter of proposal because uh the man in the man 's opinion the advisors what have extra information that you get get from the website and also uh there 's no such thing as uh difficult is n't scheduling it 's just last minute people
641,2,the two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumer are first uh try to make it as user friendly as possible that is to say as convenient as possible for example when the ketchup as the in uh manufacture with a flexible plastic container it has been really more convenient to the user it just had to give a little squeeze an you had the amounts of ketchup you want the other uh way to appeal consumer with the design is to give the container a pleasing a parents so that the consumer want ste to exhibit it at home for example if she sell cookie is you 'll should decorate your backs with nice picture to make it look classy
642,2,um i plant had a special structure to um reach this time and and it has a host like usual trees it connect it 's to you ger trees to structure itself to reach the s and sunlight and leaves click spike spiky leaves help um replaced uh sing go nutrients and it her is it takes no nutrients from the forest but it can it could take the nutrients from the dead leaves or the um the insects from the that which connected to the tree and it ca n't re store the water to so it helps
643,2,so he does n't agree the wa letter says because um in the website it has only basic information but it 's not beat held but advisors can give students extra information uh and what requirements um graduation nice and what what kind of classes need to take the advisors can tell old those detail information to the students say and who ever does n't have schedule um ever does n't uh schedule their time it 's way is uh there is that uh schedule opening s for students so they could always to in the schedule for it so it does n't the letter does n't make the great dete assess
644,2,the problem the speaker are discussing is uh there are some new save to companies to for formed the boys concept the past had to uh solution the first solution is box a please but and wednesday the movies help uh the two people become here just friends that they have more time to practice the second solution is uh play with other bank on next saturday then they will have more people to come to see them but they will have film time to prepare to perform in my opinion is that uh the second one uh because would people will comes here and that will be make his well the sense uh
645,2,the student wrote messing university newspaper and uh there is written that uh the student trans phone to have the advisor because first of all uh he can get the information from the website and additionally uh it 's uh ge waste of time to uh schedule that uh meeting time with advisor but uh it 's uh it can be quite uh controversy of the uh while they feel look an opinion of other people first of all uh the website is not uh able to give the same uh uh if the if efficient information to the student and therefore uh everyone needs advisor to get extra information about graduating or they can classes and uh second there are another problem that the one who need it does n't need the advisor is uh having problems schedule time because uh there are doing everything of our everything late time and that 's why they have problem about time
646,2,recently i about a book named the greatness guy this book is written by rob in who who is famous writer writer of the great the other book called the mall who 's or does not only the book many explains about the leadership qualities personality development and quality issuance to carry out because in the lid ship qualities and quality students un personal two development skills which are more important for a person who wants to growing his life and achieve great hide d also d the interesting conclusion is given in the greatness guide his
647,2,uh the perfor the proposal just in the letter uh is to a meet meetings of students and advisors because every necessary information uh he has already been in the university website the man expresses his positive opinion about the uh state uh because uh he comes it is that that would be no not enough information on the website about graduation and uh certainly it would be much more um through them to speak with the advisor uh also he does n't consider it to be a problem to make uh schedule um because every student can have some free time if he arrange the meeting some the sport
648,2,the plan only have is that there are no weekend no weekends uh before so they can perform before the summer um and the only daily have it 's on wednesday if they the solution is that if if the other band let um pe perform uh with the daily have they could just stude even though they can do other the songs they did n't preparing it would be a good idea if they just perform this that uh the little time they they get a couple of sun like one or two songs would be enough to that the people know who they are how they how a play cut the the instruments help day the sunli the play and everything so i would take that i i i would recommend that that day the performance saturdays they daily the band is
649,2,the professor in the lecture discuss about the importance of design of containers and she gives two way is that a company can the line the container to make it appealing to the consumers the first way is to make it convenient and together she gives an example or containers that has that containing ketchup minor and it is much um convenient for the consumers to use plastic containers rather than a glass containers because past other much flexible ea easy to use the second way of appeali making appearing design is to make the appearance more attractive for example she gives a container of the cookies and it 's it 's decorate the containers tech read it will be much attract uh and uh by uh consumers will like they contain likely product
650,2,um the book but i like i want to read because every party is talking about it and there is that 's why i like may near going on and and i just want to know what they 're talking not because very says it 's such great law story like romeo and juliet but i i do n't think that anything can be that good so i think data s book i want to read because um my friends told me that it 's a good book and i just want to d to get um the my own filling about it and my on the season the p d d
651,2,i want to read the pro the leader um the german novels because uh the film weeks fill week for few weeks ago hm eyes so the movie the leader with my friends and it was very of magic because uh the main cake choose name is spanish meet and his bend allow up with uh thing here are old with senior of the boys we she was at the reach you years old and they 're left each other so uh i really want to read the book to because it was make miss so interest about the romantic uh the said the story um and i heard that the many uh friends too many friends fu had a space to write a book is interesting
652,2,the urn to highs hm they are are very common in a rain ste hm they usually uh that opposed on the branch on the trunk or trunk on trees because the trees are so high becau um they can do receive the enough sunlight so they have a very specia mechani is um to support their lives hm actually they have a very special unique leaves shape hm leaves shake um it 's like a cone shape and their flower is single and how can day get a new trees it they did not going to choice an from the soil and otherwise um um they got the water store in their leaves um the ol insects an plans uh are washed down and they they get dig this composed and they get nutrition
653,2,uh i think there are two ways of food or also pro products container is uh for the first one is a user friendly and uh another one is uh beauty phone attractive i think th uh uh uh the the beauty for uh get foo design and container uh can be car as a or plastic and uh is good ten have some picture on the hm and uh can attractive the uh the users uh and they user friendly uh design uh may be of a plant uh paper box and uh and uh it 's really easy for uh th so much to take uh
654,2,i prefer to have cell or mobile phone uh because uh even though there are some quick is seasons uh i know the cr decision that uh because because of bringing cell ph or mobile phone the people began became at dependent on the mo buyer or cell phone so they they might be addicted to cell or mobile phone but but it is convenient for me because everyone has the phones so in order to keep in touch with my colleagues i have to use cell or mobile phone
655,2,the university decide to can sales academic advisor some man disagree with this the exposal and the reason is that first uh he thinks that uh uh also students can get information on the website but the sometimes you can not get what you want if you have a advertiser you can deal with difficulties at the first time and you can communicate with the advertiser second um uh also the school said that it will be a difficulties fall meet as made a schedule for the student and at were quite sur but the student thinks that if you make and schedule already make a early plant with advertiser it want to be seems difficult for you to meet each other and it is the student hand advertiser uh an so the man um think it is had not satisfied with the proposal of the university
656,2,according to the ring the epiphyte is uh unique um know plans that uh in the rain forest have all unusual mechanism to use nutrients because their show shot uh and uh appo plants above they they cannot accept the sunlight so that they use the host plant to platform they role of but not have um chan to get the nutrients so that the unusual mechanism is that says you 'll nutrients in the store water becau in the solve or to have a the nutrient from the insect that leaf and one so the other this same can make a no student for food from the other plant so that they can as up s uh this uh water buys they are roof and also uh using the host plant to grow of to accept the shall lie so that seas and usual mechanism help the re epiphytes uh one so get sunlight but also have enough nutrients
657,2,the university plans to change graduation ceremony by holding uh two ceremonies instead of one ceremony before the woman is afte uh objects about the um plans and she thinks that it 's very unnecessary first firstly she suggest that uh it and taking a long time um because of student see down well it because there is uh another solution just to reducing uh just by reducing speech time and can solve this problem and also uh she suggest that uh the or uh the hall to s more enough to read and to uh that that he much um that 's very well it because um allowing students to him of bring too much gets maybe the rea read them so she thinks by reducing gets invited then the problem is so that 's all thank you
658,2,hm people part the product and not only um by itself but also hm by the containers hm so uh we can uh uh a appeal the ke um consumers to buy the pro by doctor by two major ways uh the first one is uh make the container uh useful and uh friendly uh and and the uh the second one is uh hm get the container uh pleasing a parent j uh for example um if you uh cooking something as the uh container has uh pleasing a parents maybe uh the a cookies uh well be occur rock and uh it was uh seems um very in delicious and uh so uh makes them friendly and the pleasing a parents
659,2,i i'm really interested in reading is the twilight saga uh since i have watch the movie i form the movie really fascinating an interesting and it as insect that the book is given better than the movie so really i'm looking forward to read all the cities th th the movie uh has to displayed in only two parts uh they 'd are to more parts remaining so i'm really interested in going the end of the uh story so uh they doubtful parts in the books cities so the next thing what i 'll be doing is reading all the for parts of the books to know or to uh get the complete idea of the book
660,2,product container design then enhance the appea to it 's customer by two ways first is to make it user friendly or very convenient the example was given for uh uh ketchup or mustard uh con demand uh which was previously the spent and uh glass bottles uh which provided with the problems of boring and uh as well as it 's storage uh plastic provided a good alternative for that and then the pleasing appearance of the uh container the example for that was given uh about a cookie uh cookies back uh which were leave earlier packed in cardboard boxes which uh do known tender them attractiveness but packing them a rather in a metal box with nice pictures on them uh enhanced its appearance and thus appeal the custom consumers in a better way
661,2,uh harry potter serious is a book there 's i i'm uh i want uh i want to read uh first of all because it 's uh uh as a book about mad req and i think uh i'm a car for con uh uh creativity so i think it my gave me some inspire ins bus about my life and uh furthermore uh uh uh i think it can improve my english uh in reading uh and in contrary and uh hm i i can get to know more about the school life uh in reading and uh last but not least i think it 's a phone fun it 's uh uh interesting book and he can make can my life more co clo for and uh uh get me more entertainment so i think
662,2,uh in my opinion i do n't to choose to take my cell phone with me all the time uh first of all because uh it 's uh to the to communicate with others at anytime and uh if if you are in some emergency and you can gets conta to with your friend or your family a to s at at once and secondly i think uh uh uh we have a very i life with uh much more pressure so i do n't like to listen to music uh play some games at free time uh so i like to take my mobile phone with me and last uh it 's uh to a for me to surf the internet at any time if i want to get some information about the uh others
663,2,the professor provides two ways how container can be appeal to consumers uh the first example is ketchup um before um how to use to make container as user friendly as possible for example um before the ketchup or mustard will was so the in the glass bottle so they have to either s grow the lead or pole all the sk pour or scoop with the stone however with the flexible plastic um it the consumer have th can just squeeze them material and the second point is um to make um the container looks as pleasing to consumers to they so they can display at home for example cookies if they put in the nice but metal box with pictures the people will um be more appealing to buy them bec civil be size
664,2,professor states that uh consumer does not consumer does not buying the prod the goods it 's self that take should the goods should contain and container so container is very important uh so the people s is see what which brand is it and container shows it uh for example of the container should be con convenient is uh it is uh one example is plastic that uh in ketchup container that uh if it is class container it can be very messy and uh if it is plastic it can be more attractive big because it is more convenient to years and second reason is it 's since that it has too busy very good because cooks selling cookie
665,2,the book that i never uh never read but are interested in is the his the normal history of america uh my reason my reason exam following aspects first of all uh the history of america is one of the most uh important history of the other of part of the world history and if you want to know more about how the how the modern world is uh come to like these you must in know hm the long history uh that the never can go what 's the go through and base down the statement i want to read this book
666,2,the man make uh uh bands and will have a concert in next couple week the problem is no place for um no place for performance and uh the time is very limit um and the next problem is i one and that there are two solution available one is uh they can perform in the wo wednesday and the task or people to add attend it the other solution is uh play with the other bands and and uh um and uh take together but the problem is um some time is limit limit and they might ca n't play all the songs they prepare
667,2,urn plants are wrap seeds roots uh around th th uh some kind of uh track or uh a tree and uh in the this kind then they can uh survive in the rain uh forest uh they get plenty of uh sunlight and uh at most of all important uh uh but the option a strategy for the urn plants ease uh that uh they uh store water in a the allowed to leaves and in uh this way would to the the composition of uh over the lead to wa species that live there they create their they need to regions sorts need it uh for uh their life and they you see there 's a liquid fertilizer uh they are five it 's uh use also uh uses use also this person a deca strategy uh when they use a whole
668,2,the man 's problem is he ha he span want to have uh show next weekend however the place for the show will have being a ready boom out and the man have two suggestion the first one is maybe he they can they can have the concert at the middle of the week and there will be special and however the man also said that there will be a small test during the weeks so they will be a little disappointing and second suggestion is her friends of another band have uh make the concer at the saturday and maybe they can perform with them for a while however he uh by doing that they may have much time to to play all the song they they prepared i think they should joining the concert bra her friend accept they for that uh even the only a little time but they can still pr pair play
669,2,uh according to the lectures the uh the professor explains house and the u urn plant to uh have adapt to the life in the rain forest focus um first about and the urn plants uh uh on the upper branches of the tree and do the and he has the unique shapes to store water um they other arrangement of the leaves can help uh them to uh keep the water and the uh for example the green washed down to say or something and keep the water in the hm so you and the um also he um this kind of plant can uh find the con keep the the source of food and um through the this can through and uh this kind of ways see uh it 's uh the plant have adapt to the life in rain part
670,2,there are two ways that a products container can be designed to appear to consumers first one is to make it easy to used and second is to make it attractive and these two these design course can be explained by the ketchup container firstly the ketchup container was made in glass before uh use so hard to use and the customers had to sus could with spoon to use it and now it 's made in plastic which is more is to use because customers can just use litter first on it and the ketchup come up and the second seeing the attractive but like it can be explained by the cookie container you if you is s made in plain cardboard box the customers really not be attracted it but if he is made in nice th box read nice really for colors and then he can attract the consumers
671,2,uh the this business class and uh and uh the pract lectured the pad that product 's design can help afte uh attract a lot of consumer to buy i uh their uh this lecture uh show two way to to do the to do this design to better and the first one is uh uh can some kind of a design to make uh a lots of product ch or to more convenience for people uh for example some food uh lots of mustard uh over them and can be it 's a very easy to help the consumer to eat it and also enjoyed that the other way is uh some can can you some he may j to on the some product to to help people to choose it for example the cookie occur use a small box and some picture on it
672,2,so they dealing with uh plan is the uh a certain they do n't have a day d that they can demonstrate and the performance any of the band and they have bought apart for a long time any but the problem is that they do n't have uh certain day in maybe they wo n't have a te uh they the rea find the schedule appointment that they can have out the students that watch the concert but uh this uh i believe the if they have the show with these another band in the play in the beginning and they can show to all the students because all the students so be thereby down money they can demonstrate how good they are in they can play just a good songs of the ones that they did n't get and they can cho to have one of rome ca read excited want to see them more and then they can have one portter news for the next time that it had a presentation and then they did n't have a lot success i have they take advantage of this first uh opportunity have with this another group and they can have dig
673,2,well according to my opinion students who wants to get uh better grades in their classes should uh keeper uh normal attendance and it currently there are attendants which a fulfilled according to professors requirements secondly i think uh the students should uh be actively answer questions in classrooms and uh they will never be action though afraid to ask uh all also questions so the professor will leaf uh give a uh in expression to you so the late they should deliver their papers required uh in time and
674,2,i'm interested in reading book the minor my stephanie meyers because i in other read it and everyone they dan everyone is saying that is a great book i watch the movie as really interesting so i would like to know the details and uh i think that book is right for me because i love the story and i'm like lot stores so it 's a proper book for me and my friends side there is a really interesting and nice talk so that 's my reason
675,2,uh the uh the woman hold about perform help weekend at the bo story that has been booked uh by the other uh so there are two options first uh uh the bad for ha what they act as they will be passport his is like the bad for at big but with with the other that there are uh the the time is very time they are not much time prepared to get uh uh but i would have ci every then the second option have two reasons first um good perform his not just perform th all his uh it 's it 's it way is it would it would itself so uh of of together ha will have a but you have that he all his have much ot teacher section uh more uh most out small effects so that is good
676,2,people although people might than by the it is also very import there are two ways that uh that this can decide appeal customers first break the computer tree to his uh for example uh the city such as ketchup is good as glass but if need this aspect they is everyday at at all at work import go buy it uh well by the plastic it help of will buy the ketchup uh student by hectic uh uh a section uh the second way is that he appearance for example his the his uh by uh metal box that help pictures party it wou which selves because uh people they the book his uh uh because uh it is very attractive that the peoples and also thinks that his exposal every dishes if the uh tv appearance of the metal box
677,2,well according to the lecture uh the the passage the author many talk uh talks that the advisor meeting should be required because of two reasons first uh the useful information already uh available on website uh of the university and secondly uh some student go to office cannot a meets a professor uh immediately uh but the two student disagree with this a lect uh li letter because of two reasons to and firstly the boy think the basing read uh the uh basic prob a real uh the basic information on web but a lot of information you only can meet the professor and solve the problem problem the professor can finger or te uh what you want and secondly the why things uh cannot i meet a professor is the personal problem uh the student just can uh go to the pro professors office earlier
678,2,according lecture rain forest the canopy uh for these by the upper layer of branches maybe so dense transfe e plants can grow the she has around below low even so many place have adapt live in the rain forest accordi professor urn plants root portter branch a lot of trees uh sometimes they help trees uh it she is very various so the urn plants is like sunlight uh many plants uh adapt li in the way forest real branch around of trees sometime a they help the trees
679,2,i do agree with that the people should take their mobile phones with them were ever i go and i think firstly is because uh special for students they radiation is really not get to their health because if you bring a cell phone with the and you have to suffer from the radiation and the secondly some people use cell phones stea serve the internet or plenty games wherever they girl and uh whenever they are and uh uh some students even use cell phone as a to to treat in exams and uh or the cell phone also can distract their attention from the teachers when they 're having classes so i do n't think it 's a weiss action to bring a cell phone everywhere
680,2,so how epiphytes have adapted life in the rain forest well it uh it 's uh because of persons traditions a friend flow it can stay alive from from the sunlight uh that i store water their the fun self they have the spiky leaves for this there i got the roots around the trees and they this trees uh is made for support uh leaves or so uh receptacle they have a unique shape uh in water and uh like other nutrients and the uh water supplies have liquid and uh with the leaves and they have uh upper layer branches to it
681,2,the proposal says that uh it 's not necessary to ca n't with an advisor uh to registering persons actually uh and the lady a need the student to says that um uh every student can go to uh can be see the website uh to look for information and also she says it 's difficult for a student to find time to schedule uh uh and meeting with an advisor so she thinks is better to to to do it by by herself rather to meet an advisor to role to registering occurs bad and uh they uh the guy after the propose uh after the spate math spread the guy w the conversations his he does n't agree because uh at the same to to talk to advisor uh advisor th often have lots of uh extra information about scheduling uh uh about about the person i about scheduling meetings he says
682,2,this p ice many people like help they uh cell phone um not like to have their cell phone with them i really like to have my cell phone with me all the time the first reason is communication is really important for me i uh preferred so communicate with and other friends uh while i needs secondly i use the other functions of my phone for example action that gain all cups later therefore i use all the time my phone uh so the phone is really important for me uh i always um take my home with me all there are very i'm going i take to me to use it 's all the time
683,2,in my opinion the cell of for the most convenient convenient to in these ever um first i can i can text i can get in touch with the phone with summon buying is a cell phone to be specific uh um i can i can uh i do n't need to search uh papers in the street uh so i can he can uh col uh anywhere or in everywhere
684,2,uh the speaker is trying to hold a concert um hold a concert uh on campus auditorium however since they campus auditorium is already booked so do only time there is left for him and his band is next wednesday night uh since um i would recommend him to hold his concert on wednesday night because there is going to be a lots of time for his band to perform their songs uh if they perform their songs on saturday with uh friend band uh there is going to be less time for them so that uh they are they cannot show their whole musics this is why i would recommend him to perform on wednesday night not on saturday night
685,2,uh since when consumers buy product they also buy containers contai the design of the containers very important uh two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers is uh convenience and surface to creation uh first of all um the lecturer uh gives out an example of ketchup uh when the ketchup was first invented it was with that glass a container so we could will need for the ketchup soon to or uh nails which is not uh convenient however after changing it into flexible container we can use it in better way and second uh she also gives out an example of a cookie uh why uh a cookie with a nice box look really nice and look attractive when give out to our customers
686,2,um so um this point is to appeal consumers so um for example um we need to makes it consumer user friendly with the project um and for example um flexible plastic containers um for example for ketchup um uh easy to use s um glass uh hm sp room for example p last hm the project needs to have a pleasing appearance for example uh box of cookies um if he can p um customer has your own box it will very be very pleasing an appealing for example if you are get if you have guests
687,2,well uh the proposal consist in um so uh proposal to reduce uh the website uh um um the man uh in his letter is playing explains that there is no need to schedule a because this to um complicated um um uh in reaction to this letter um the man expresses his opinion uh to a woman um uh is he says that uh it is not the same thing to go uh to the university uh the sun uh the the website because uh when you well on the website there is uh no need to insisted and nobody explains and uh when you go to the i mean street
688,2,as far as i'm concerned i would like to have my phone or or mobile phone with me at all times because uh the phone the phone is already part of my life and it 's very convenient to use a phone uh with with me all the times i i want to get to the uh phone from other peoples and as soon as possible and also i i do lots want to uh put the phone uh on the other places because i do lots want get them i want uh uh use them and once i need them uh that 's very very important
689,2,in the business class the professor uh talks about the importance of the container to le a product she said that uh there is two ways to make the product uh more a popular the first one in that to make the container uh more convenient to to use such as uh uh flexible plaster plaster container it 's easy to use to uh uh people just need to give some squeeze but some the class when is not good enough uh people need to sk roots of uh the container and uh another uh way is make the uh p container uh uh a pleasing looking uh such as a nice metal boxes uh this could uh looks very nice and classy
690,2,i like to have my is cell phone with the with me auras time bills and not having be uh first of all because i like to contact with my friend most of the time so i can send message and call them and secondly the self i can use cell phone as dictionary while i am studying english i need it and i can have information or news from the cell phone to f so the i think having cell phone is very important and useful to my life
691,2,the professor talks about buying product in business class and she mentions that the people by containers not only and because a product which they care about the brand first bill um the the people buy the products which shows friendly like for example my student ketchup th like if the mustard and ketchup business side of plastic container it 's convenient so that people would like to buy but what if it 's inside of the glass container maybe they will drop and get messy so they like it and secondly um people like to pleasing i pre appearance like example cookies they act they have nice pictures on it on the container
692,2,dull summary summary is that uh uh do n't uh do n't they during her do has di are di want to want to d d uh uh dor and d his he want to i want to play d and once they do do n't d d d d uh the uh da on this do uh d d friends den d d and they d d d d
693,2,i prefer to uh that uh the cell or mobile phone uh with me because uh uh it 's once responsibility to receive a uh others course um be hm and uh and it is very important to communicate um with other people uh at any time they need it and uh besides uh uh main there is uh uh emergence you can guide the information uh immediately uh uh uh the last point is that uh it can keep you happy because you can make uh communication with your best friends
694,2,the two waste uh product product container or other eq first one the user friendly container and the second one plea i did uh a container with the pleasant pleasing appearance first of all uh coming to differe user friendly container it is made of book to plastic the plastic container it is a bad plastic container and it it consist awfully for example if if you glass container is mo is not more the con food move that much can then the plastic container plastic container plastic one is more flexible and more easy and his mo say it 's fasted easy to preserve and all those i'm uh coming to the is second second uh type a pleasing appearance container that is for example cookies the cookies that a place in the uh i do n't box that placed in the atom walks and i do n't books is uh because uh and i do n't books east surround it it is beautiful pictures and to a tested it attracts of people
695,2,uh the in the given listening passage the professor talks about a concept of epiphytes he uses to exa uh he uses to mass is in order to explain uh how epiphytes survive uh survive the first method the the plants uses is to uh the uh to use the bowl at the base and rolls down to the bowl uh so that they can get gain some water for their survival and for second method they gather uh other nutrients from that uh animals of plants uh this plans or wash it out uh when they are are the washes out and become stick cake decomposed and they gain uh uh food from this uh which are
696,2,i would like to read but i have not read is al alchemist the reason nice like this because is about a man adventure i like adventure and it my experience adventure uh motivate me to uh do a lot of things and and i think this book uh show the character going to adventure toy i would like the uh know about that adventure second reason is about the transformation of a character the main care to going to transformation
697,2,there are two um ways term make the container and more attractive to buy the product the first uh is th has to bul in the friend you 'll and that for example been ketchup but i am must root in a glass metal it 's really difficult to to get at i would but in a plastic container and it 's just kind it 's cause it out and it 's very convenient to use the other uh is that the container should bul um pleasant to look at and for example cookies in a simple paper back is not that attractive than cookies in a metal box with nice picture on it which you can improve and to will ge rest and um get the feeling that these cookies are in the man will then cookies in a paper back and that to make the
698,2,the man um does n't the going with the letter for him it 's important that students um get direct talk to the at why room they class uh main low problems can dis another and very much tooks can be given um for the students which is not um possible just that meeting the um pictures online and if the student uh makes uh appointment early enough there will be a good songs that the her her schedule will will feel to for by his the student and the advisor and um it 's like the man run s trying a bird uh at the state at it is now that the student has to go the student have to go to them
699,2,i prefer not to bring um my cell phone with me everywhere everywhere i go because i want to have my private time like it to think about myself sometime i do n't want to talk to much wish many people i want to think about my cell watch should i do in the future what should i do what you uh i do tomorrow and i want to think about the problem that i want to solve in that time i think is better that i do n't have cell phone sometime
700,2,i prefer to have my mobile phone with me all the time uh because uh and it may enables me to communi to communicate with my friends and family uh it is uh because uh the sometimes so i have i have friends the living and uh in another conscience family and i like to stay in contact with them and i was going and with their lives also it is very useful if uh some accident happened uh and uh so you need to help and you need help and you can come one or it send text message there will uh help you d
701,2,one book that i 've never read but i interested in reading is harry potter i am reading in i and interested in reading this book because many friends of mine had told good things about it they said it 's an interesting story about uh a boy re study in uh nice cool with his friends it involves also magic it has a a kind of mystery and i want to read it because it 's a collection in there is something about to know five books and i like to read collection 's
702,2,the two ways that a products container can be designed it to appeal the consumers are to made these these proud this product it use friendly and inc pleasing ad and have a pleasing appearance making the product use friendly means to make it convenient to use so that they are more attractive to consumers the example from the talk is the plastic container from mustard that has change and the market because now consumer some are attracted to buy plastic containers then the glass containers they are mar practical uh uh the pleasing appearance it is important because make the container they may the container became mart attractive so that con the consumer can s play than at home
703,2,according to the professor there are two ways that attract people by containers uh the first one is that uh making uh user friendly container which is uh easier for consumers to use uh for example uh if there is a ketchup in the container uh it 's very um convenient for consumers because uh the consumers have to storing the park of ketchup and it 's very messy and second one is that uh the container should have good appearance uh if it has for example if he has the books for cookies which is very nice metal and the creative uh consumers are willing to eat and feel comfortable to per
704,2,in this conversation man and woman was talking allowed mens bands that has started and they might have concerts and think they 'll have concert in uh in can in the campus uh a lot rock and roll and but it is already booked for next weekend and he has two suggestion that uh they might uh on weekend weekday and they he might do it other band and i had like to give search in the second which is to uh to perform with other bands in auditorium because they might have more audience and they might be popular than what they are doing on week weekdays and second in my uh uh there might get to the friends because they worked heart therefore i would like to give search ch an to work together in auditory
705,2,um this boy is the member of a band and they will perform after uh in a couple of weeks and then uh however they meet her probably is the when to performer uh and uh uh that um the week uh the wednesday is the so ten seat uh so they have for trouble in age and that uh they but however uh they have all fishing to other choice uh for exa uh i think uh uh uh this uh they can change a time to perform uh is and is a reasonable for everybody to to save the time to watch is him
706,2,uh perform the bring the cell phone all the way time because it 's very convenient uh i think is some some people does n't like bring the cell phone because they do n't want to pick controlled by the other people 's it because they bring the phone you have to get a phone call and the somebody will fine you 'll gray you about so somebody they do n't want to bring the cell phone and i think the cell phone is very convenient because if you have the something on the find some people you can take a phone and cold think it 's very convenient things
707,2,d he strictly playing that he want to of the concert but uh one of make appointment some the concert her that they ha they off and uh d next week d they do n't have any uh empty and date from fill weekend so he have to plan the first one is that he he want often their concert the wednesday the second one is he will join another band and make because concert on saturday i recommended to their joint on the ten of the saturday because uh in the on the weekend is like uh many people like this like the musing and they can join during them to stay enjoy text music and are so many people they coming they rate so i think recommended to said d
708,2,our write the problem is that uh the the boy in the boy has a band and they want to play the play they they want to play and they have a term of the university that is where the want to play its completely booked uh i would rather play on the street than play in the auditorium because many reasons the first reason is that is that many people can that here your can hear your songs can know or you and you have the you get the possibility due or people to to know the of songs are and get a little bit uh famous in the university uh among the university people another reason is that he you 'll have a good a if it 's not reading uh the people can enjoy the more the concert because they can they can have a a good time in in the in the glass of the gain university camp twos uh sharing some trainings and having a lot of fun and they are not in uh in the tow sarah they they have playing the of the space to dance
709,2,well the book i have not read yet is uh their from from the function by fractures think and i'm very interested in that book because i heard a lot of it uh supposed to be very scientific uh and realistic and uh supposed to be really uh fun reading uh very exciting and uh yeah i think the character 's uh supposed to be very good uh uh well uh or note supposed to be a great book
710,2,the book i have n't read but interested in is the to the light uh first of all the story really um really interested me and uh secondly the book is re uh read by everyone and many people but it 's and it 's the really will sold and uh finally uh it 's recommended by many friends or families are teachers of make of mine and this is really the book that i want to read and uh it also
711,2,um the book that i have have not read but are but and i am interested in reading is twilight stock up um because recently i i a saw th new moon in the movie theater and i think um they 've been hires stories and were wall story is really good and really love the story between the where was and then tyre and human
712,2,well if you ask me a gets of pare said that some people may criticize that the mobile france uh that uh takes are p too much time for our life uh but others may defend the ant uh mobile phones make our life easier uh it can make our uh walk be more efficient uh but my opinion would be like there 's uh i mean now the take the mobile phone all the time because i hate to make form calls and the send or read my e mails our the day and so i do n't have time for my family and my friend i want some frie with the time just a wrong just a myself read a book to into the coffee and enjoy the life i do n't want to take the cell phone all the time
713,2,well in this lecture the professor is mainly talking about how urn times uh adapt it itself to uh the environment of rain forest uh this kind of time th on doors near upper part of the tree and use the tree as a support in order to get enough sunlight um then because of it 's unique form and structure like the long stiff leaves with unique form that and flowers the helps uh this pare uh this plant collect rain and uh other uh nutritions uh this uh this leaves uh can collect insect and uh uh water uh lay down on the leaves that uh the structure just a like of the leaf just like the nutrition paul for this plant so that 's the uh main contained of the professor talking about
714,2,well there are two student in the conversation are talking about the urn a problem the man has a problem because i he joined the band he play the guitar and uh they 'd will hold a concerned but the problem yes um the other team in the book uh put a low concerned for the next week so the they do n't have a press and they have to waste to cell phone the next problem one is uh like can the uh chance for the the other day and uh uh well if i were the man uh i would choose to uh to choose to the dor uh choose to the whole the concert on saturday because uh my their plan it will be free and uh uh a lot i will the spend a lot of time that to performers but
715,2,i 'd acts to uh to uh to talk uh i was it like some uh uh pretty it in with you in uh there are some or things and um things is n't there choose look uh choose this book uh because is the best books and to his action actions
716,2,uh there is a book that i have um uh uh the have not read but are interesting in reading is the book about uh making friends first um uh the book teach me uh uh um and much learn how to be friends of this um it 's you also saving eight we complete hardly and share some topics and i can learn uh from the book how to them pick up the topics uh uh and second uh at the book teach me uh an about how to communicate with ten years because they can teach some if parents about some difficul things uh uh and interesting though auras
717,2,in the text the university has you should the retirement uh that has it should announcement that it is an requirement for other students to meet an academic advisor and to help them select courses and will also advised the of the other requirements for graduation but uh the person in the reading text says that it is not useful because all the information is all ready in the website the university 's website and also it 's difficult to schedule a meeting with the with academic advisors and the man says meeting like the academic advises is not the same thing as reading information on the website because uh they ca academic advisors can provide lots of extra information as they have an in sign to the at the deep knowledge an to the class is a give more useful advices advice um her for him is it 's no problems scheduling
718,2,when i prefer to my cell phone with me the time this is speakers well i just want to be contact with their one all the time they do n't i do writing surf i go own writing on my own i just need a cell phone a something happens that i can call like emergency something like this um when the male of explain a moment uni mom listen have a going to own so i was going to be reachable for her uh i was when i have teacher native to reach or so that they know everything a so why because she 's to stallone years she followed something happens that will be no one like having a clu about it so it 's really important for me to people contact especially with her and to have the cell from very in emergency situations that 's why i prefer to it
719,2,the letter take that advisor meetings about that that they 're person advisor meeting should not be required more and it says that um due to must see in at an advisor to get as try inf uh about course uh has or your graduation are and then it move information the want that the letter also says that there are websites in the website the university you can find all the information about and the other hand they guy is not agree with the letter because is he says that uh he does n't see the problem in at are going to see uh an advisor because if you go early you can make appointment did a have any problem and also you can talk with somebody also find information or uh going to the website a sl or assess that
720,2,in the lecture the professor to live are two ways to make the container more attractive first way to make the container user friendly that is to act to convenience to the consumers when they buy the things like he she gave examples of food if you use plastic containers to contain food it with uh be let more convenient because they do n't have to mess the things are they do n't have to remove the lid before they eat the food and it is not if the enters as source in the glass glass containers and the save time if the product is contain in a very nice and attractive good looking container it will attract more consumer behavior like cookies if the cookie has and nice metal boxes as the container is more people would like to buy it and it give them a very different and bill form mood the time when the by
721,2,epiphyte is one of the urn plant grant in the rain fall his it get the sunlight as it grows on the big trees and it can reach uh very uh their high pollution and use get the sunlight and it has very well and leaf to for for a s storing water because leaves overlap each other and is like a funnel shape at the borrow at the base of the plant the bell can s s store the rain water when it rains and also it can get nutritions from the animals and insects when they insects land and it the wa the water in uh watch the animal down so they the uh the plants get the nutritions from the the campus they from the separated animals and also it can get food from this nutritious that 's how albatross get uh live in that
722,2,now the proposal in the lecture start it is important to meet the advisors to know about the god about universities and take the help from them it also states that it is not at all it it is not necessary to meet advisors because all the information will be on the website of the university and also it is difficult to schedule an appointment when both the student and advisor is free now the man expresses know the man has an opinion that it is very important to wear and with the advisor s clean made the advices because not all information will be on the website okay it is good that we should look at the website but some other important information we can get when we go and meet someone and he also states that it is not a problem uh when it 's not difficult to schedule an appointment with the advisors we can should do the par not appropriate given people on early so that it is not difficult
723,2,the man does n't a bit letter and he gives two suggestions the first suggestion is that um not all the po without advisors other people also have many basic information so if you take another course there are planning of other advisor and they can they also have plain enough information so they can help the they can help you in the second suggestion is that if you go early they are then the professor or peoples ada advisor schedule would open so you can listen to their opinion order information from here for example if you go late or schedule late you it will be hard to meet them i also this costs about that
724,2,i would like to mention that cell phones have many reasons to use work uses uh first of all you can use it uh when you have your own business like me uh it health paid to stay in touch with my uh you know friends and family uh s over the speak about it but i partly practical have a old family my mean a parents who who are old so i need to keep in touch with from incase something uh s today will happen with them and the second one keep touch with my friends were correcting business with me involved in business with me so uh it 's it 's like reality uh tracking the reality oh from what happen in the business
725,2,they are pros and cons on every aspect of this question um first of all um if you are if you have your mobile phone uh with you all the time you you also available all the time and you have no privacy left uh you can call um uh a con cla is that hm uh the this is definitely a country pros that if anything happens uh be uh that it be uh um uh uh a neck student in your family you uh you can be reach would n't seconds and uh and come to your family but of course you can call themselves
726,2,the two ways of uh appealing um the buyers interest uh for example uh ketchup plastic container is much more think a functional than a glass uh fit with ketchup just because it 's much easier just to squeeze uh the the plastic container uh uh asked to uh as to uh get the ketchup out with uh with a spoon um the other way is to is to please uh they the experience uh for example box of cookies uh can be designed the uh in a very beautiful away and like this there um the by will displayed at home even if the cookies are ie old uh old eaten hm he the by a could keep the box and display it
727,2,things for i have out a lot of things about an example they could it and i will always like to read the book as my friend towards it 's about the leadership seasons of a man web created an an by that is an exam that they grade he uh he had he have mentioned how this man have concur the most but most part of the while the of his own official only diminish and of his own goal so i will love to yea i will love to read that book as from my house tells time i was a greatly that means i was really efficiently that that book my friend those that that wo book have mention that that book will not uh help me to make a best clear out of me but it we should leave bring a better yet out of me so i will always low to book to read a book on an example they
728,2,many plants adapt it life in rain for th uh rain forest developing strategies for survival uh like urn plants uh wraps it 's cell phone trees for support and also to get sunlight uh its unique shape helps the urn plants to store water and gather nutrients uh friendships is a good example of how epiphytes have adapted to life in a first because they develop strategies like uh as the uh fans i said rapid cell phone trees and it 's a stretch she for support and uh also a stretch a strategy to get sunlight in order to live and uh also uh when it rains of course and the plants are highly on the trees when it rains the water would go and to would touch that leaves in order to live
729,2,the first way that are purse container can be design is that it 's usable it 's for the customer it 's to like it it 's convenient to use for example the woman uh at the lecture with the example the ketchup um the ketchup was in a glass and was n't a glass and now it 's in the flexible plastic container which was much easier to use like because you just have to squeeze it and another way that a products container can be designed to appeal cons consumers is that um it 's pleasing appearance for example um the cookies i want in a metal box um they just look nice and not little just a pleasant
730,2,epiphytes have adapted to live in the rain forest um was some strategies um the epiphytes grows on uh house tree because um epiphytes do n't get a lot of sunlight um because of the high trees in the uh in the would and the own plant um use that her s tree um to get uh nutrition for uh for herself and the unique um shape of the leaves and uh they collect water and j the nutritions and that 's why i that they get the nutrition of that unique uh shape so it 's like a it like uh uh leaves uh
731,2,the book that i want to read is uh some rather be enter for two reasons first of all my mother reads a lot of books uh during uh he 's uh he her life and told me that this book it 's very good and i think uh uh and i know that uh his creature is very good and the second reason is is um spanish book and the bird able to spanish book so i would like to read it because i do n't read their a lot of the spanish book uh at this time so decide two reasons that i want to read less another that bid
732,2,the two ways that a product container can be designed to appeal to customer consumers is uh firstly one one is uh user friendly uh uh for example uh be the plastic containers um uh which are very you convenient for the consumers and which uh can be used uh faster and easier uh before the pur it used to come in a glass containers are very it was not that convenient or and they had to um uh take take it out with the school so which were not uh friendly so the the plastic containers are which are coming right now with the very user friendly and secondly uh it should be pleasing um to the customer for exist for instance um the cookies um which uh coming the plain cardboard is not appealing to the consumers uh because uh when they try to hm present it in front of the guest it does n't look good that reading uh so
733,2,the students talking about a date is better to perform with the pr uh with the band it 's better and weekends are during the week uh and then the the guy who plays a guitar in the band said that she wants to perform perform on uh and we can because sh there 's more audience there and it have to be a their performance have to be couple of weeks before the summer and he want to book there are teacher ie an but it 's fully booked on weekends before the summer start and and the girl answered uh that the his friend uh first had a band and their performance saturday and they can um form before this band but then they only can play couple of songs so that 's a problem and i thinks it 's good to perform with the other band together because it 's better the nothing with hers um it 's better to have a big audience on a saturday and then a less audience on a during the day the in the week so the small responses the question
734,2,in my opinion i prefer to tag my cell phone with with me at the herons there are some reasoned is superm idea first because uh cell phone is very important to me uh it 's very convenient hm when i fancy song emerges since a should situa action it can helps me uh for example if i i have some uh i have some i have to face some dentures i can use my cell phone to can now with my friend or my family to help me because of this reason that 's why i prefer to take my cell phone with me all the time
735,2,the reading passage is introduce a kind of plant called up time it and how to act time i have adapted to life in the rain forest and the professor support this uh reading passage by giving some information and it house and he mentioned that um uh urn plant is a kind of um plant that can can be can be we live um branch of trees or part of tree and to get higher to get sunlight and that i had the urn plant have so long stiff and they have to cone shape um to to to did loss of flower um they also develop uh kind of system to store the water and nutrients uh
736,2,according to the listening passage uh one of the ways of um appealing customers uh is uh containers called convenience to use uh she gives an example that uh a plastic one uh can be more useful then uh and can be used faster and easier than the lid one uh the second um second choice is uh doing the appearance of the products uh more attractive and she gives the examples from cookies and she says that uh if you put your cookie in a metal box with uh pictures on it uh it can see more i l again th and people can use uh it 's why and there are presenting uh cookies to they are guests i and these two reasons uh appeal people appealed consumers to buy more
737,2,personally i like to uh have my mobile phone with me all the time um um there are two reason uh the first one is uh if i had the mobile phone it maybe uh make me so per book because if you want to talk to me whether were i and uh you just call me and the other one is uh if i have to uh if i have time to kill uh i can just uh take out the mobile phone and read no will and play games by the mobile phone that 's all
738,2,i like to say i would like to read about the travel guarding book about talking because i'm really interested in having some side sing in talk your and also go to shopping and do something interesting in talked which difference um difference with type a uh although both are the same kind of city but i think talking was pretty much more innovate have more innovation problems and uh innovation senior e and also um they containing a lot of uh interesting things that which uh taiwan can really have so i think going to talk to his to really interesting thing for me and i will like to d
739,2,um to be an is a really like to have a cell phone with me all the time because a cell phone reason only is being motive fact the functional and can can contains like cheap years or contains a lot of um tools i which she can use through the internet like we can use cell phones to post up pick the pictures from um to face book or tutor and also i pre to have a cell phone because i can contact with my family will my friends all the time or anyhow i want to uh share the information or sh or something important or share event ch or something interesting to them any time i want so i think cell phone is really convenient to for us and it 's century
740,2,i have n't read harry potter but i am interested in reading it because it 's about uh magic wat uh there is i cannot use magic in the real world so uh i if i read harry porter maybe i can uh i can see how well weathered and which is use method use use magic in the in their in their work ma another reason why i want to read it this book it because it 's it 's it was reading english um i if i want if i i read this book and um maybe i can practice my english that 's all
741,2,here the man contradicts the letter which which has been sent to the university which has been uh uh which has been uh given given to the university because the be one reason is that university website does not contain every information what the advisor have the another reason is that he never give across any problem with the advis advisor so far and other reason is that uh he also there is that hm he needs everybody to and uh to schedule the meetings before before the last state so that they can how a good talk with them and uh under reason is that last minute setting up of things can make everything fancy so he he thinks that uh having advises is better than displaying everything on the web and uh dancing of all these schedules with the advisors so he so
742,2,the book about the harry potter yet is the interest in a book i think because i just uh becau uh first because i i just to watch it is the movies and this movie have a uh from passes from pass into since uh that attract me talk me and also if he have a um uh exciting exciting um contain contain uh exciting content ta exciting and help story he yet is that uh uh electricity me or food one first in due to trade get a but i did n't uh ready get cell last uh that he says that he 's a my dream i want to read here some day
743,2,the advances that he his his playing or bring a role in in a get a play an in he seek in this band andy uh uh his band is trying to she tried to co trying to hold up or what the concert before the before summer and but the point is that um although or all the rooms for all the dorms for or for performing the concert in the in the auditorium is it 's booked and uh one option is that he tries to uh their their band can uh uh his band can get the con uh her had a ho hold a concert in the small auditorium and the other option is that he can uh he uh his band they can get key ca n't can get all the what uh hold the concert with other band which is because it is bec of them i think that he has it to to cooperate with other band because he can to what things
744,2,well in this set of materials the reading passage describes a temple plant um that uh adapted uh adap the uh a rain forest and the listening material is uh uh lecture provided buyer professor about the same topic in the listening material the professor described uh um a plants uh that to uh uh adapt or the rain forest circumstance uh because uh the plant attach uh to the tree uh that she can grow up to the canopy of the tree uh and uh uh he is a special and arrangement of the leave uh can could clack to uh rainfall uh so uh uh and the the rainfall contain uh some nutrients uh uh some uh minerals so uh the trees uh can uh use a nutrient uh uh con
745,2,play uh whether the have read talks about uh visit ca n't and he 's a guide the ad visiting advisor and uh that states that the uh visit uh because of that the advisors not that important and uh it 's should ease the difficulty for student to uh make appointment with the advisor and the man was not agreeing grow what written the letter because uh what uh is in the website uh it 's not uh ask detailed as what the information you you might get from the advisors because advisors has a lot of information and uh can he can help you with uh a lot of then s uh but he does n't know that be and the website uh that 's eh so in my opinion she uh the visiting is think the advisor was uh important when you cannot uh place
746,2,there are two ways that a products container can be design to appeal to customers and one of this way is to design the product 's container to be using a very convenient way for an example um having plastic casing for products such as ketchup and mustard is very convenient as you can just squeeze the bottle which you can do with the class bottle and i 'll comes the ketchup and mustard another very effective way to have a designed that 's appealing to customers is to have a pleasing appearance an example great example of this is for an example um to have nice metal boxes with aesthetic decorations for such product as cookie is or can bees and is very a pleasing to the customers
747,2,a book i am interesting reading but they have an read is called the pride any proj days by that jane austen and i always her these book from my friend since i was young they also it 's leases a very good book and uh and they told me a lot of plot about this book and uh i was impressed by the loved little uh it 's a better and the miss that are say and i i want to start reading this book if i have chance um
748,2,uh the student sitting proposal to um suggest school can so that required advisor meetings um he sitting purpose so the nice no point to meet advisors um before the beginning of each semester um it 's say uh he says it 's very hard to schedule time we meeting with advisor so the um so the advisor meeting should be canceled but the man with but the man who has a conversation with the female student says he disagree with this proposal firstly he think uh last not very much information or meet university website about the graduate sh an requirement must be some different way to graduate from college so they ca n't require a sto e information fi advisor
749,2,i prefer having my cell phone with me at all times there are two reasons why the first reason that people on the one can predict the future so there can be some some emergencies and for instance when i when i was in the time i did n't have any money to go home so i could n't help to s calling my parents in korea and my parents just to send me money um i could i could get back to korean the second reason is that since i'm a letter talk leaves so when a whenever i go anywhere i want to talk to somebody about the situations that i am in and i do n't really so i do n't really want to feel lonely so for this reason i bring cell phone
750,2,if uh if if guys about adapting to live uh in the rain forest by seeing in the in the branches of the trees that uh our our hm in the trunk of uh the the other trees that uh that had and s than uh to uh get sunlight and move heron um there is they um like boy live uh own on that trees which can store water on the be instant and um uh the water is collectively and store that uh this kind of bowl uh and they can be a greater when i where uh that the plants need the uh food holds to to survive them um and uh mall bearing the ma show on the other the planned second uh collect was nutrients pro
751,2,the pro the proposal is these on the idea that uh that uh students should go only like to access attend informations about their courses and graduation requirements which they could have gotten from their lectures an advices uh the man is can the opinion that does not a great because uh the website is going to give them uh limited information as compared to what they would have have from the their advices and moreover they are advice as uh would give them a wide range of information which will help them one which better choose courses stated months also of the opinion that there is no trouble are taught screen it to surf i so because to come to the own time to sing fa skip way
752,2,uh the professor talks about uh urn plant um is that how or to if it fall ice have adapted to life in the rain forest uh uh urn plants uh they just use the tree to support them self s because uh they can get plenty of sunlight in the in the trees so so and then uh they have a leaves their uh are real overlapping each others and they are very receptacles so when they um live rain of water can be stored in the in the leaves so other new trees and her so can be solved in the leaves uh so uh when they actually uh there is uh uh they need to other nutrition then uh they are water start to decompose and water has liquid compulsory s so in order to get nutrition they use the leaves to
753,2,the book i would like to read but i i i would like to read later is join creations novels about the last um i want to be or international lower when i grow uh like when i'm in thirty and first i'm quite really do n't want about something about loss and that 's the biggest reason why i want to read join creations novels and to learn about not loss and second i am very interested in the english writings by his cause i rea read some of them before and i was young
754,2,i prefer to have hm my cell phone with me every time wherever go because uh accidents can happen and in time or anywhere or so in case of emergency the mobile phone is very very important to inform your relative so new ones to make show that somebody of you near one is n't acts in or in in emergency so i think it 's very important to carry mobile for every where where we go and secondly even keep nee connecting with my friends and univer the when with they will call so is very important to take mobile phone with me and with around every time thank you
755,2,as a lot of say 's that the meeting with the advisor is ca n't so was cancels uh regarding the selection of course and do requirements for the graduation but i think the man expresses his opinion that he did not agree with the proposal in this lecture because uh why he did n't agree is because he thinks is there are different classes they have to take so it 's better if the asked the advisor because they have lot of more imp extra informations and regarding shade would he had he do n't have any problem regarding the schedule and bec and if he set up the schedule op in all the of the food the appointment or before the meeting and s possible that we can communicate and set preferred schedule at which everyone have a time and possible it 's possible to have meeting so i i think he do n't agree with this proposal in the letter thank you
756,2,when definitely agree that i definitely prefer uh to have my cell phone with me all the time uh because there are many reasons uh one of them as uh you can stay connected with uh your friends your family uh an any time for example uh uh wo uh i will uh two weeks ago i had an accident what uh i had an accident i had to grow in my father to them uh so i would n't uh i would n't help gr uh that it 's time if i uh if i did n't have my cell phone with me so it is very important to have the cell phone with you all the time
757,2,designing the contents of products his very important in order to make it appeal to the consumers uh uh there are many ways to do this uh the the listening passage uh presents two ways the first one is uh u companies had to make the container convenient to use for example uh uh uh uh where uh making ketchup on a and mustard um plastic plastic containers is much easier down how it used to be uh solved uh and the second way is uh uh products containers of the products should have a pleasing appearance in order to uh in the to be uh to be more like a decoration in the kitchen or
758,2,um epiphyte is a kind of a plant that is help by um other canopies uh which live in rain forest um the professor gives an example of an epiphyte uh which is urn plant urn plant is um the support by canopies and they uh tight a root on the top of the tree uh the they have a shape of their leaves spiky leaves and in uh shape of about which gathers water and um get box and from that uh water and box they get their nutrients from their own uh not from the tree um you can see the epiphytes um uh survive from in the rain forest by this kind of uh type of living
759,2,uh i have not where the uh interesting in reading is a harry potter series chil which know there for what does n't away yeah there are two reasons why i feel this way told first thing as it is very interesting yet also it it discu why uh many characteristic and so is very interesting for me to s to read the which read this book and second thing is it gives many would patient to imagine he does n't yeah harry potter cities contains many many future first thirt culture waste such as flying
760,2,so the professor mentioned to more um different product groups um for example the first one was the ketchup um uh plan some some gives ago it was and designed in it and in a glass um in a class to um which was n't very comfortable for the user um so nowadays it is in a plastic choo which is small uh easy to open and there is no mess on the paper after webs the other thing was the um cookies which were um designed or could it in into and uh um then the parents like a metal box for example um which you can um put of the table when you get guests so these are the two um different design of the product um whether contains uh container are and important
761,2,a book that i'm i'm very interested in reading is uh the book called uh they gain it is a book uh by new s trou s uh i have n't read it but i have heard a lot about it it was uh it was uh the book uh no uh a lot of people they talked about the book during the summer uh as it it 's a book about the a guy who uh it 's uh interested in uh in getting uh getting women to like him and how to score checks uh he uh he uses different kinds of the miss a children and it 's become a kind of the grow uh in the in that feel
762,2,i prefer to take uh my mobile phone with me everywhere i go because uh it 's uh so important to to to have uh cell phone and its required for all the to for all the time in the life because uh if the is some problems i will uh i can deal with um by making a call with money phone and there 's there as were anyone wants to reach me you can hold oh my phone and it will be uh quickly great to solve and because it 's i ha have an got the phone if i have not not phone it will be so hard to be for people so how to reach he and and uh the le the pro s of the problem
763,2,the reading passage a set of material describes the canopy produced by the upper their what is so dense do do these density they are few plant that can grow under the shadow of these plants the listening they in this stalk these storm describes the young plant which is of tied ca n't any produced the bad plant has a unique structure and shape this unique structure is like bold which is used to store rain water this plant has what spiky leaves and f levels are having on single s th this unique shape of the unplanned not only not only holds the rain water would house helps in gathering nutrients from dead leaves dead insects and many other things
764,2,we are bring the s the mood phone obviously if you read it everywhere because hm most of time uh my parents will be tracking me by calling me and then if a students to have the phone if you have some accident or s also um so they happened that that you need to call some him to help like uh called an never want if you if you do n't have a phone that it will it will it will very bad for f for you into s such uh in their searched the situation because you ca n't uh get some help instead just calling
765,2,um the rain forest it 's certainly difficult because there are different levels of plants in trees so they higher trees cover the light for the hm the plants the char on your them but for example epiphytes have uh adapted to life in rain forest they use host plants for platform and to grow over them they do not use their nutrients but days them like their support for example this a kind of epiphyte in the urn plant that has um especially especially shape of leaves for they can uh he can of um take or water and uh all the dead leaves so it can also take nutrients and it is it is used like a receptacle who are the rain water is collected
766,2,uh there are two designs her to uh make the product appeal to the consumers offers to make it uh as useful as useful as possible uh such as a uh a lot of s ketchup which was a glass and they have to take the lord of and everything ano it became plastic and a flexible so people now just pour it ants now more useful another a design is they are making uh making it there more pleasing in appearance where uh will uh will be pleased to have it in their homes like uh a back of cookies uh you can put it you can make its band who look uh more like the color shiny and put it in a class or um more plastic or uh hard uh lot so when you uh give it to a visitors it will be more pleasing
767,2,well or me uh epiphytes uh have adapted go uh to life live in the rain forest normally they used to straight that search shape so it 's a unique their ch uh it 's their unique shape has is uh where they have uh they it 's about shape uh uh at the agrees uh makes uh allows rain water to come down to the s so bowl of water uh just bulb were uh uh the epiph uh epiphytes conserve the water and take and take it also they they take nutrients from a lot of plants the uh happened to calm on uh on the epiphytes and then they go down into the a bowl and the work what they as water they are uh actually uh there are uh liquid fertilizer
768,2,i mo most to person is now with his cell or mobile phone so in this case i am not a person that i'm give treat of his phone at all time so i take it myself all the time uh you know the trees the old five features like e mails chatting and all a mess and messing years so it 's not just like phone you can just message of friends all the time we can just text which are fans from other countries any time you can get or emails instantly but there are there are so it 's commerce impossible to live your mobile phone without to at any very good so that 's my choice either
769,2,in this proposal letter the writer thinks that having advises an cancels or new class because there is information on the school 's website but the man disagrees with the he says that um he says websites only have basic informations so uh if you talk to cancel or advisor you can have different opinions and they and advises can help students more then then then they need i agree with into because um we can we can basic we can necessarily find the um formation on the website so uh if you talk to someone we can or a better idea and the opinion of your going to do
770,2,i think a book that i have not read but i'm interested in reading is the time not to not written by the better never very uh it is about the life and that is uh i can we think about uh my s that i have about my life and i think it will be very previous just precious experience were me and also very never various the might every library and uh it is uh very anticipating about this book and it is a fiction or s thing and it can give me more expressed and create keeper about it for the reason the better now there is the
771,2,so uh the boy is not uh mall they the problem is that advisors uh are going to to be or it 's going to be a requirement so advisor meetings so uh they uh the letter is against this uh because the le in the letter they uh they think that the if this meeting should n't be uh a requirement the boy is is n't agree he he does n't agree with the letter he thinks that is had the same uh too busy the website and to have family film when someone that can help you with classes with uh scared tools uh uh also uh and uh they and they are another person girl help you to figure out your your nears good to also uh he thinks that it 's not so difficult to set up an appointment if you go early and if you do n't um go and they last moment so
772,2,i prefer to have my cell rather i go because there are cell phone is very important if any but you want to reach me they can reach me wherever i wa i am in and they can call me wherever they want and in my phone i would uh i me may receive an important to me and message from the company of the phone uh hm importance of from my friends uh uh it 's so it 's important to have your cell phone refer heat of uh uh uh and who can use the calendar views another uh talk later meet these times under uh he tells ingroup phone just not for looking
773,2,well in my opinion uh i think having a cell phone or mobile phone and with does uh well sa th listen times it 's very useful just incase another you have an accident war it loo someone or you need to find very lost in any to contact someone you know they it 's very useful but um depending on each person some persons down do n't like having phones with them i think it if a list for some times in some okay sh to really need phone to a contact with the rest of world so it to get d
774,2,now consumers not is owning buy the products they also buy the co the design of the containers and the the goes to attract more customers is the first one is to use uh as friendly as possible the materials uh for example the lecture use uh the ketchup as insect bulb plast that uh bottle is more flexible and usually the attract it attracts the customer better and more and because is more opinion 's so customers we are willing to buy the products and the second one is to use a pleasing appearance for example the cookies if the cookies the containers of the cookies look really nice and in with beautiful pictures and the customer would think that is more classic so they will buy
775,2,the man is having a problem because he is performing um uh rock and roll band but the campus auditorium is booked for the weekends the man is two suggestions one is to perform at wednesday and the other is to ask a friend uh to uh uh friend band to letter perform with them i think the man should choose the latter option this is because uh because there would be more people attending the concert them and if the more to pour perform better he would learn much more thing then performing on wednesday although he play less songs so for that reason i think the man should perform with his friend band
776,2,the man is in role in a band and a pen the ca fetus they would planned to ge give the concert in on campus the problem he man th is uh the small audience and the the time not it 's not enough it the first problem he said it would would uh invite some other bands to play with together um and the second um second through uh in the resolve relation is to uh to give up some songs because a time is not enough in my opinion i think uh maybe the second suggestion is much more better because the small is beautiful maybe that the smaller songs which will be give more surprised and in price th in the audience
777,2,the professor talk about talks about the design of containers which is which can attractive and on to consumers first first the professor says about the friendly and convenient to use it 's that for example the professor dis example uh ketchup uh ketchup has a plastic plastic ketchup container is better than the glass one because it is really it more attractive to consumers because they with a little screen stay can uh if they can get proper proble amount attracted and second the professor gives an example of pleasing appearance pleasing appearance can be uh very attractive gives example of cookie containers contains has s metal box and it 's really decorated because is to attract product to consumers
778,2,uh the boy is facing a problem problem is that uh his band is kind uh to have uh show in the campus uh but the the auditorium or uh will uh are or booked for the weekend so uh he said uh he now has two solutions and one is there is a small auditorium in the wednesday night uh and uh these second solution is uh in other band will play they in the next saturday they can play with them together uh i prefer the first solution because the second solution they uh only lacks one week for practice so i think choose the first solution they can have enough time to practice them perform well
779,2,the student long straight band um uh he would like to the band like to uh make a show is too uh on the campus auditorium but the campus auditorium is already booked on the weekend so they ha they cannot only make it in the middle of the week on wednesday but he says that maybe in that they 'd just because it 's in the middle of the week uh they they might be a smaller audience but they have another 's option uh they can do it on saturday uh because one uh there is another band uh performing on saturday um but these band allows them to play after their concert so they can share the the concert day uh but uh only if he accept this decision he can only uh he they will only be able to play a part of their um song so i would prefer i would suggest them to play on s wednesday
780,2,there is a band on a sunlight asserted that they are ready to to perf to make to make a performance to and the problem is that they have only time the auditorium the school term is only available on the wa and once they and the problem is he think that uh they receive little audience small audience than they would if they would be on week and solution comes up uh that uh band is willing to share the time and a saturday them only catch is that they brown uh wooden get much time and only will performs other other something bad they originally want to play um what i would recommend was that they they are good uh people were men or i'm of them even if they play to or or to a one sun and they should share share at uh the state with the other be it has readily accept the teacher with them
781,2,the proposes that is no need forest uh for a mandatory meeting between the students and their advisor since that all the in a basic information needed uh for uh for the students is already uh uh put op on the wa college 's website on the university 's website uh be opinion of the uh other person uh the first from the woman the proposal because he says that be with the person who specialize is and that certain fill these much better these simply interrupting with the website which has which only has the basic information regarding information uh that uh the advisors uh already have on the should uh he also uh says that a person uh the person who wrote the proposal is wars like their person with it for the last minute to schedule a meeting with the advisors
782,2,the reading passage uh was talking about epiphytes which is uh host sing a tree and uh living uh underneath it for with in the forest the professor give an example and it was called the n urn planet which wrapped uh the roots to for the support around the tree it gets the lights by uh uh by the way she wraps the roots and intere try to reach the be uh the light uh it has like a bowl forget in the water and it uses the small uh as will uh not or not not only for water but for inst think that might fault fall down and decompose later on and become fertilizers when they need uh nutrition and and and food so this how the urn planet lives in the rain forest
783,2,uh i never read ex lives than it 's about when prior s an is ca uh i like this book bec uh i i i guess i will i i'm a like this book uh because this kind of uh like uh sign section and it is is full learn ste and and it 's an is uh there is a last story inside of it and these uh there 's no and thing they they should
784,2,i like to use my cell phones everywhere we label but at some places i need to put it the switch of more because while driving if us cell phone is on it may distract or writing and it will accent and uh saw that head it is and uh re displaces we need to for the cell phones an silent mode i prefer taking them everywhere i go but it in a silent more when a wakes we need it filmed office in other play is if it 's distracting your then you need to put it in a silent more i pref all owning them and uh i i think them wherever i go but use it according to the place where the wait see it
785,2,the professor is talking about contain design and she if to factor that that are mean the uh the strat strategy is to get there are mean the uh amount of consume firstly she insist that uh friendly design is one of the strategy for example for the container that made the glasses uh can be transform to plastic come plastic so it is very convenient to use secondly she incest that pleasing design so for example cookie uh cook he container with nice picture look nice so appealing to consumer more
786,2,there are two students discussing about the other student to um started a band they want to have a concept soon in the auditorium but the problem is that the auditorium is full over the next weekends and the band members are way for some they have some solutions for one is to play in the middle of the week but they are s get that i'm not many people are coming the other is that they can perform with another band but the problem there is that they can play every s form in the rapid while i would recommend to take the second solution play with the other band in order to do so they can put together under the mentally with the best songs of the band and show the people in the auditorium how they can perform and because there is a second band the out from his room
787,2,there are two different ways and to appeal a product container for customers one is the user friendly design the lecturer made an example with the ketchup bottle one made out of class where they use where user has to get other rest the spoon the other is the plast bottle where the customer can squeeze out the rest in the plastic but it 's much more like because it 's my stu him the other way is the pleasing appearance the lecturer made an example with the cookie box and house its nice to have a cookie box with nice design like a metal box with pictures on it instead of having a paper box with a simple the sign and is not likely to watch
788,2,epiphytes can survive in the really first um because they use a technique where they have a host plant um on which they are able to get sunlight through the host plant it 's possible to gain water f which wings down but they do n't use the nutrition from the host plant because of getting the sunlight and uh epiphytes are able to grow on shady ground the urn plants use the same proc tewo by using a tree for for support because of the unique shaping of the urn plant they can store water and survive that way
789,2,um i think have a cell phone uh with uh review wo is important because it can be useful uh in um sometimes and um you can reach people from a long distance s you do n't have to go actually it 's uh to this person 's house and um talk so him um but i it 's not necessary uh to bring it uh everywhere you go because it depends on where you are hm if she 's uh you are in a countryside it 's hard to use phone but come
790,2,an example have epiph right uh is the urn plant and uh it uses uh plants uh uh host plant as a platform to uh gets access to the sunlight in order to um to grow also um daily of their urn plant has uh have um special shape uh according shape like a bowl which which um a water is um is um gathering and also sometimes some insects because there and start to the campus which some natural uh nutritious nutritious sector substances can eater
791,2,personally i prefer hm the cell of song every tend everything a time and uh open in the all the because personally as from i have my reason my family is living in all uh living or cite the of the in a these days so if they have emergency they can come me number two the reason is if i have something uh generally speaking uh when something happen emergency i can connect uh to the schools and to my the god ie and to my classmate let the know uh what happened um me and uh wash lie do and sometimes a few years that is at all we should bring the phone all the time
792,2,the professor uh from the example of urn plants uh they are having uh we wraps or two branches and some attracts uh in the upper part of the tree it have it is having a unique shape uh bowl like the le final composed too high sunlight and stores water uh it 's uh with the kind of cone shape the single stem and uh uh in which water student and nutrients are uh before the uh decompose to nutrients with the reach food gather other nutrients and it also gathers other nutrients uh uh by which insects and it loose from the other plants are uh decompose p uh water supplies whenever it needs uh the food the upper part of the foo uh plant
793,2,if peop uh if i th or the plants uh category uh which are recycle some host one for basic neat like us for survival like a sunlight and uh and water as accro uh one of the re uh example of epiphytes uh urn plant uh which he um uh which has a leaves uh uh and that found like a funnel save the two uh uh uh to absorb the water rain water and uh other uh other nutrients uh so this funnel uh i have uh hm this finals become kind of for re receptacle uh for uh for the nutrients and water supply to the plant um it 's uh um so this is a uh this is a kind fertilizer that the the plant uses for survival
794,2,the man is not for the idea of within a letter he prefers having to get dormitory schedule a meeting with an advisor reason being he states that when you have an advice uh there are more things that would like to discuss whether that some of the things that are usually uh that are than some of the things that are uh written in a website he also pref i has the advisor because the advisor will get out of the topic as compared to the website whereby it will have to stick on the topics or on the discussion that do n't on the information that you require next for example if he required some information about at the admission or about the graduation he have to play caught graduation so with that information is display did n't are only talk strictly about the graduation and not any i 've aspect that might be needed by any student or uh student who would want to know more information about the graduation that would be taking placed
795,2,i prefer people carrying the cell or mobile phone that i'm not everywhere but people her coming from the phd concrete they need to carry the cell phone wherever they go because this the want which places to con tied the person who he he has to talk work or his there is only communication which he can do with the phone in some cases that is not the case like if you have phone everywhere in the classroom it 's uh it will be disturbing so cutting cell phone to everywhere is not ga
796,2,the some li of the proposal is to made that the advisor and get hold of the courses which he has to take the student the man expresses his opinion that the advi the not to cancel the meeting with the advisor the reasons behind it is yeah when you register the courses on line he do n't know end of information regarding the course be new goal in person with the professor use no lot more about the course and get to know what is a better option you go wet and this will help the student to choose the right course and then you have a lot of time to be just or the courses or meet with the professor so having of the things to and it my sep everything
797,2,i would prefer that indies mobile phone with me all the times uh there are by the few reasons for this uh and number one is mobile phone actually uh makes you it actually bridges the gap between you and the and the people the other end in that way you stay closed their loved ones and the other reason is uh uh mobile phones can come are very handy uh at the at the times of them urgent in order to uh uh give a call of distressed and as for some help in that we i i think mobile phones are marry uh very very much useful and appea pollution be worried about uh the uh the news us of it because the advantages of having a mobile phone is a lot more than this or this
798,2,the proposal in the newsletter is actually uh of planning the bases meeting before each semester and the uh man actually disagrees within uh uh disagrees with the opinion of a person mo student letter uh uh in the newspaper uh supporting the band the man actually says that uh uh the advisors' meeting should be conducted because the advisors have a lot of knowledge uh lot of knowledge to help a bow a person uh in selecting courses a much act and uh and uh has of this uh helping them it and different uh course of uh action in order to complete the graduation and the second and the second no others second uh idea he states for supporting uh for uh actually defining the opinion of planning is uh he says that uh scheduling an or or an appointment with uh advances is is pretty easy it simple uh i hear of the semester
799,2,the proposal 's uh outlined in the letter two dev an university basically expands the students initiative to cancel the student advisor meetings in the university because he feels that uh it is out that uh the website information is sufficient for the students to to be informed uh the opinion of another student is however that this is uh uh somewhat strange request because uh not only that uh student advisor meetings or beneficial because s more information is conveyed to during those meetings but it 's also he he also address his a concerned that uh there is no time to arrange the meetings because he never experience such troubles and he feels that people who wait until the last minute to schedule an appointment
800,2,i prefer wearing my cell phone everywhere i go there are three reasons the first reason is because i always want to um give a call to someone inc um when i'm an emergency for example the second reason is that um a cell phone is good when you have some time um an when you are boring um you can spend time with the games on the cell phone and the third reason is that i stay in contact with my friends because men i am an home i do n't have the time to found them so little small message to them um keeps us on a friendly relationship
801,2,well the teacher explain that consumers do n't only buy the product but the container there and so she said that design of the container could help to so the product um there 's two examples like would be better if the container is more convenient to use like more comfortable she made an example about bottles glass bottles and plast about but plastical better not s messier the glass bottles and another one it 's but the cause that the container will be better not just it will be better if in a metal box like really pretty design picture are
802,2,the professor talks about the container product that the professor talk about the product container and uh he mention and she mentions there is two important the design those the first it is the popular uh the container must be so popular by people use if people are not used it to the so must must so popular and they and the people would attend to another container and the second one is the second the design and go is comfortable uh and and the professor glasses uh example about the stating sitting cookies and the shape mentions that and the container with the beautiful picture with the make a the customer very comfortable about the cookies so they want to buy so they want to buy it d d
803,2,the book that i want to read and and and i am interested in reading is called harry potter i it so the i watch the movies on the movies of harry pot of but i have met any books of it hm i want to read it because my friends uh he spend or nights reading it and he said something like the story is more fun and is more dis created and he 's he always he always said that the book is always better than the movies so yeah so this is the reason why i want to read harry potter hm and yeah i i'm in this summer break an want get one book uh try to read it
804,2,uh in this conversation the man and woman are talking about the band and the thirt uh the man made a band he plays guitar and the band and he wants to have a concert in next couple weeks before the summer begins so he try to book the campus auditorium because it sounds good their however the problem is that uh the auditorium is already booked for next week for like next couple weeks and he does n't have during room for so one of the solution is that he can perform the music on wednesday night uh middle of the weekdays and another solution is that he can he can um perform the song with other band so uh and if i were him i would perform the sun with other band because this going in on wednesday night they are not many people to his
805,2,the man the problem if that that uh the uh h he has a band but uh the wo they want to buy the uh play they band but the auditorium is booked uh in the weekend fro um the first solution to the problem is to play in the wednesday night and the other solution to the problem is uh the uh plays a ba band in the next week 's saturday night with another band i think this they should um play in the place band in the wednesday night because uh the uh they all the talk smaller all the ta they will or played the band they when the uh small all ti at they have the bad a long time so the uh playing i with other band is very frustrate it i think so uh le uh playing the uh the band is take should have the experience
806,2,urn plant is the best example for epiphytes and how they adapted to life in the latest d urn plant uses tree for support and to get some like the day uh adapt to the top level dealt unique a shape they they have o uh o unique formation of leaves that is all fall on they all bowl shape that uses to store water for so that will help import a sentences d as well as helps to gather nutrients and dead formation helps student that food by the uh chemical breakdown so in this way the urn plant hel uh sh uh lives in the light that like the life in the rain forest d
807,2,the professor talks about a product container can be designed to appeal to customer for two reasons firstly a customer buyed not only product but also container inside so to appeal to the customer uh firstly uh friend designed it 'll uh who um friendly they designing real uh works world uh so uh for example plastic ketchup that most that it will help uh the customer to use it because glass glass is really hard to scoop of and you will make the table messy but by squeezing it 's easy and clean and second secondly uh a comfortable cookie it 's so uh the make a box really comfortable for example cookie it 's classy and easy
808,2,uh the proposal of i mean relieves and uh s s newspapers stated that an importance about uh meeting with the advisor uh she stated that it 's uh the all the in for that she need is already on the web and it 's very hard to schedule meeting with the advisor but the man student read uh that proposal the stated that they uh the meeting with advisors is very important uh to discuss about the uh fair is ways about completing um task for the graduation and also to take more uh more to discuss about what classes you take and about should take uh uh hm suggestion from the from more experience lecture
809,2,in this conversation man and when discuss uh concert planning uh um this now boy is uh uh found of teacher and uh he participate in uh band and uh they are going to make uh concerts and definitely this concert should be uh in couple of weeks before summer ant uh the problem is that they do n't for of the tall room uh for all um an until summer uh they play rock and roll that 's why uh they need uh hm auditorium to make it will uh like to fall loud music but they say and uh they try to find um solutions like go to put their to do concert on wednesday in the mid week and and as a solution is um to play as a warm up who pole on saturday with another band as for me i would prefer second variant because uh woman not pro of announce a group will um give opportunity to
810,2,i think i belong to a group of people that prefer not to bring their tall or for or mobile phone with an everywhere the reasons i give for this is that i understand that the mobile phones are an instrument that we should huge uh to uh f for for us i mean i i do n't think it 's uh something that uh uh uh that we should be uh uh paying attention on all the time and in sometimes therefore respect in respect to rest of the people which when using in some kind of situations where the assignments uh should be the most important pe
811,2,in the the woman it 's uh explains to waste of for the waste of uh let the products containers uh uh can be decide one site she she talks about uh uh um they do they they use that the container should be very useful and convenient and uh the this me this means that would be comfortable to to use and the other side she talks about uh she says that there are the design should be attractive for the customer therefore should big nice she gives the uh um the example of the cookies but instead of uh uh of this so in uh plastic uh box he says that it 's uh it 's hm nicer to be selling a metal box with the nice pictures site
812,2,in the lecture the professor says that uh when people by thinks they are not just of by to production um maybe uh do and they will look something on containers first uh if the uh first s containers must become we need to use a like um the plastic uh plastic pla plastic uh is pla plastic container is hm must flexible than the a glass uh is can be faster to remove and the second is to have a pleasing ap appearance uh for example when people buy cookies they will want to buy um nice metal box uh boxes occurs is uh look uh more beautiful and they can get some pictures on it and the thinks that uh look block sick uh can make much appealing to the consumers
813,2,i prefer to carry my mobile phone everywhere i go uh because um living in a city uh far from my found the city uh my family live in uh so i miss them a lot and i ha i have to uh heard uh ap uh help their he is some hear about them okay so i also have a new p you uh uh my uh young others is his uh has a has uh down and sun and i relive means money verse so i can communicate with my nee feel by mobile phone so i would like to carry my mobile phone so i can commit my family and my uh younger other sister and might need p you might choose native uh so i prefer carry my mobile everywhere i go
814,2,in this set of material the reading message introduced uh uh epiphyte has which means that um had had to had could as dead to do a lot in the rain forest in the lecture the professor had uh uses went examples to expand is different eq definition and the example as um the urn plant urn plant is s have a plenty sunlight and it has a unique shape can habits so on water and some nutrients and the rain water of their doubts about went ca it can store the storm water and it more also can s fun some feels sources and uh let him uh her hm um adapted to the like in the rain forest
815,2,a book that i have not read but are interested in reading is the new moon uh the reason is that because i have so the movie in the movie theater uh which is uh the movie version of the book and i really like the story very much it is about the love story and i think love story can next me cry because he will reflects my own feelings about my own love story and also because it is very famous among my friends or my friends have read the book and they they said it is really a good with good book
816,2,i am the one person who uh prefer not to bring surfed or serve or mobile phone with me i unlike all the time because is like for like school um like for my school like i am an allowed have cell phone uh if i like have cell phone to bring it and i gave big trouble and i minds it 's key co from it and a certain public um area but is not have um cell phone or mobile phone so if you bring mobile phone if you like kind interesting or something asian culture they you may like not every to be uh get dinner that 's my perf
817,2,well there are or the book that i have been long for a long time hand bad for the for once is a brief each he of time we can buy thing hoping how it was it instead of book it lean fall be interesting and meaningful uh you know when i was in high school there are the treasure of study and of an other feels it de pick most of time and i have have n't in uh nancy a time to read it but i her it i have being not in for astonomy ball long time and then they will know the elec s they are meeting so i really want with boring if i have the opportunity i will that all thank you
818,2,well the man is holding a band playing rock and roll in the campus next wednesday e night not well in my than man some cut some problem other words thus nece audition in the campus then in this day so he decided to live it another band next saturday night so he can you can get uh more addition and more songs to play and also there are the last a important uh so they could only to save save some songs will last the next ten or clear it late now the only asked one so i i prefer the prefers they uh play with the band next saturday because i uh uh invented many popular in the second thing is a lot of audition and they can pay more music they does n't wait
819,2,well the professor is discussing the importance of the containers in in the product saving well if than he gave two examples to to uh to talk about the container it wit done to print to appeal to consumers one is uh uh material that that of the container you know uh the plastic container is it 's much better than a good book glass container ways case on it for it 's more convenient uh there are more more beautiful and also the another ant ample about the cookies its a cookies its uh contained in on little metal box with uh with fully the greatly is is more beautiful a nine are more nice nicer you know the in the consumer will be lent to to present because they are more appealing so uh first uh two examples from the pur the professor
820,2,names uh man s just new band with his friends and he wants to introduce his music to the broader auditorium so he decided to old to rent the place for for uh for uh for the concert and he decided that do it will be in the uh most pop her play seen a car so uh he but the problem is that the uh the timing is uh how to say all the time uh all that everything is already uh booked in the month so he does n't have time for the weekend so he must decide to play uh has a support band her hi at the weekend or to have a cell a concert con con uh on wednesday uh my uh the recommendation is to have a cell a concert because uh it is always better to present him sense in the for light no matter home or who many people come to the camp to the concert
821,2,running persons there is um uh uh uh pop he opposes the letter because uh he say i think students should be able to see that the advisors to discuss their options and uh the then extra information that they cannot obtained from the website for buy something whether in the website uh uh that 's one of the reasons uh his given uh to uh it 's does n't opinion another opinion um is uh that uh he thinks that it should be no problem scheduling an uh appointment with the between student an advisor which students do not wait for the last minute uh to schedule the appointment uh they should have plenty of time and he never s up that any problem scheduling any appointment with advisors
822,2,the uh both the students are talking about uh one of them one of them have have a band so they are going to perform for the first time and they are perform is in the middle of the week on wednesday so he stating heard that they they they will be there will be less unlike this people going because is in the middle of the week so they are inviting another band another branch so be able to have more people and so they could perform and have more people to assist um in the concert so they will be performing
823,2,di do n't do n't to make a concert d campus auditorium but it is being doct so uh they 're planning to d d uh weekday d odor they have d d d another point on saturday debts it one they want enough time uh to play odor which d d d uh d odor d music they have the o so i my recommendation is they should take the favorite song and and then uh the another so it will be more because da or swarms are they are also it 's d d d can help the listening of the other d and it will be d d d
824,2,there is a letter pose down the wo uh newspaper ask for cons so the advisor meeting because stead all the information about the uh courses at on the website people can just just uh get the information online and also meeting professors is hard for both of the time schedule to mate but the man a seed is letter he do n't agree with this occurs the information on website is totally different than the information that advisor can give you the advisor can help a lot by graduation and the classes tra chooses to benefit yourself and the man think for this uh to meet professors people should though early that 's why um they have hard time to um appointment as uh meeting at the last minute there is always a lot of schedule safe people go early they can make appointment and find a flexible time for both of them d
825,2,uh d d example away d firstly is to use the host plant as a platform d get one some like dor example di urn pla die and it wraps branches around tree d d d game or some light from the shady part of the rainfall uh d secondly have d uh epiphytes get uh water by using d d shape for example uh the or and its unique shape d uh it as urn or what shape daughter dull the way how do is does his d to have leaves or like d and so the water rolls down to the dorm in rain dead leaves that lives in and then has some lectured in competition that help d nutrient to grow depth one d and lover together d
826,2,a student wrote the letter to um to the university and and said the he thinks it is no need for meetings at the beginning of the semester where information for the for the new students or for than for the next semesters provided he says that all the information is in the internet and that there is no new no need to go there and that they you um they often have problems uh scheduling scared during uh um a meeting the boy says in the discussion says that he does he he does not agree with the with the student who wrote the read wrote the letter he says that uh it 's not the same to get information from the internet and there are different ways to perform um information when you when you talk to to uh to another student or to drop and uh he says that there is no problem with scheduling uh meeting
827,2,the letter writer 's proposal is to um recommend the library to shortened the uh book keeping time into two weeks and by the woman uh she disagree with the uh wi with the ri this idea because uh firstly uh she think that the time using the book depends on how students use the book uh for instance if the students um as abou to writer researching type uh uh he or she with uh has uh which holds the book on for a reference for a long time and s also um uh for students needs the book and sh he or she may order it from the state uh library um in a program called interlibrary loan ants another library who has book and the textbook can send it to rese who library
828,2,uh in now they customer buy s apart that but on the uh look apart that but thinks about their container so me there is two way to uh to to wait to the sunlight to pick appeal the customers uh at first uh you can uh designed as use friendly as possible because on the container is uh more a convenient and they can use messy uh they can just call use friendly is is better um the second way is a pr eating a parents um the the box of for example the cookies box if if you would look nice or classic and you can just like a guest to the friend is is more or or classic and con your friend will be happy and you were happy
829,2,uh it has stayed a band and he wants to make a concert before the summer the problem is that that they do n't have much time because they are studying uh the auditorium is booked and the only two solutions uh uh are to do it when wednesday or uh with a small audience or saturday with uh with another band but a bigger audience uh i would recommend them to do it they on saturday even though they they a could n't if they do it then they they would n't have much much time to perform but but it 's better because they they can and present in front of a a big audience and uh start being recognized
830,2,well having your mobile phone you at all times hm i do n't think it is good thing i prefer urn uh either not to have uh cell phone at at all or just to you sitting certain her a special okay sh an such as one when you planned to go on uh ro tree uh or even they do n't go of water a city work you might need for my u use he might use uh cell phone in case of an emergency uh i think that having a cell phone all the time concept with you uh when a by that people will be able to reach you uh in every in every situation in every location and not at all times and that is uh for me s it 's it 's not good at all
831,2,um the first uh way uh that a product container to that can be designed to appeal to consumer is to um can uh is to make uh and user friendly container which is easy to use um well one of the examples is man is but they uh need uh to remove lead first and so the second example a container is a flexible plastic container which is mount which can be open mass fast much faster and is more convenient and the second way uh ove um making uh a container more appealing to customers say uh is to to make uh nice decorations to put it in the nice box for example uh cookies uh they can be uh put to a nice uh met me tele books and uh this way they can be presented uh ep uh in a very good way to consumers and uh can be very appealing to them and this is a perf this is an example the professor makes
832,2,the proposal in the letter is about meeting an cat we advisor before going to the university and um well it 's he has uh any information in the websites or they think the academic advis does n't need but the man uh states his opinion that well the way in the website has base information but he the ha and it 's not the same with with uh with having an an advice swarm in kind advisor so they think it 's very uh useful for them and they have a lot of extra information for them and including they do n't they do n't have any trouble scheduling the the advice so they do n't think it 's a problem for them
833,2,i him inter seen about hm read the book about from prior s because now uh as a by is talking about they uh when wide and sun glass for there 's uh books and also they 're they are agrees about is this just top so i am i'm interested to know more about the from par life by uh decide them uh sons like be interesting uh a lot of people uh they are saying that it 's a good good books in a and good movies
834,2,the products contain the product 's container uh need to be designed to attract a attract and useful for the cost the customers so uh because moons uh they do n't look only plant they will look um the container so and they they look for the who 's friendly uh and the more att attract she um container so they exampled of there is that the ketchup in a bad as uh was may was with a glass container now it 's ma it 's uh with a plastic containers so it 's faster and easy uh it 's more comfortable for people that it was n't uh another another think it 's uh a nice more rocks i would be for pick it 's it
835,2,in the letter uh student a proposes the opinion of eliminating uh meeting with advisors her as requirement uh she explains that uh they only information that advisors provide can be found in on the web sides of the school also she could see that it is very difficult for students to set up an appointment that the back advisors hand in contrast at the s students uh disagree with this uh proposal with this letter because uh they could because they consider that advisors can provide a lot of useful information additionally to they want that can that can be found in the website also because it is of students have one have problems if they schedule the appointment and that he really stage
836,2,i'm interested into the book that inches called which i have n't read yet and this is because the very interesting topic it covers it goes about the controversies about or everyday life the controversies about the feet we have in us and um uh most untrue this will to see last books acc popular so to see all the all the contents and all the speak with my friends about this book where they already and also interested to read because i really impres she their writer den brown who is really bring the net read some of his books but this book i miss the ni that 's why i want to really
837,2,the problem the speakers are discussing uh uh one of them about the the time to make the concert which is well bathe uh in the metal of the week in state of the weekend because um there will not be there will not be available on the weekend so uh i think it 's in the metal of the reads uh a good idea because it 's helps uh students to get out of the stress from the studies and uh break uh academic tin for some for some times and uh the other problem is about uh this get well and how they would share with another uh students th play the rock and it will uh in the campus and that good to make some ad variety
838,2,approved expanded than pitt designed to appeal to customers an uh to be s one is uh uh making it user friendly and convenient uh for example uh uh uh by lessening continent the uh it can dis uh it can be uh uh sell than a plastic container it is easier to convenient to use rather than a glass container that uh as the really uh problematic um they could and messy and also the other thing is uh it it can they did the pleasing appearance and it it should be can be made at actor so that uh the consumer hers hm buy it uh get attracted we do n't buy it and they i did n't uh uh did n't take plan would n't displaying get in the house for example uh cookie is can be has sold uh metal boxes uh the pictures on it uh which will adapt the customers
839,2,uh epiphytes either plants in the rain forest uh that have the test adapted to the conditions of the rain forest uh tool wo n't with their uh canopy is dense uh the actually attach to the host plant and uh uh grow up high an actor receive support and uh to the sunlight uh i urn plant as and an example is an example of epiphytes because it is it is a p uh uh it usually grows on uh the trunk of the trees and which is where high to go get sunlight and uh uh sense uh he does not edition of grou addi that the it 's the ground later it ke uh does n't give the car uh nutrients from water and so it 's leaves that uh uh shaped and such that they form accepted it at the base and they collect water and that uh uh basically the rain water and also uh i do n't to collect see uh insects and uh they bees and uh the phone one before down to this of the girl and uh uh form nitrogen afte uh rock into decomposition and uh this is

842,2,the professors since the the business class and the consumer buy a product and also um so that they are two examples that consumer um want to buy uh one one of those is um plastic container um for example ketchup because in kind of a cause it looks uh friendly so that um consumer use possible um the plastic container is more um much more convenient also that they are um another example is cookies if um the maker is using the encourage poured facts maybe if they are use a beautiful uh matter of park and with the pictures and it is more attractive um to consumer to buy um a cookies
843,2,uh the epiphytes have it plants which grow over the other plants uh they they depend on the plant to agreement towards and grow in their they do not take any nutrients children from them but they distance to grow on both so that they can just capture the some like which cannot be uh the student can or bec lecture under the chil that they do not take any nutrients susan that they have a need in the kind of them to adapt to tuitions of their important so urn plant uh it 's an epiphyte lecture it in which have a dickens uh distinct features of use which actually have uh uh cup cup uh by peop uh live in the form and whenever there 's uh uh uh rains fall they did n't structure the water and and is that uh insects dying they are kind water into nutrients that uh the nutrients that uh are did and maybe you can that the form nitrogen and so basically uh they they survive in this country
844,2,you know when it comes to a book that i want to read definitely it 's i guess she pos recent book i mean under gets of course first of all i love and so much is my heron when in turn as a particular so i love the know everything and it should tell about his life and how he was preserve and how he good that talent and could be the display or river the word it that i have seen in my opinion of course in addition to that i believe i guess he has a part of the very nice person and used to help a lot of people so um so interested really to know up a lot of this that is and how used to help people as it he is my role model in this regard and finally it 's success a story i mean to get it from beginning to and so it will teach me a lot of lessons
845,2,urn plant give us a clear example regarding the adaptation of plants in the rain forest first of all the urn plant uh it grows and branches or trunk saving of the host tree so and moreover exams is the leaves are uniquely shaped in a cone shapes or overlaps together and addition to that the urn plant uh it it it has a unique system of protection and getting even uh water against the rain forest for example it has a unique shape uh when it grows over the as uh the tree tell for the host the host a tree and go the competition looks like the the there is a bowl to make eq storage for water so it keep water and in addition to that it clean it 's from insects and give it gives the there is a plant itself source of nutrients whenever need it
846,2,i prefer to take my uh cell or mobile phone raise me uh at all times uh have some reason uh own one is that i want my pour friend uh i won might borrow friend call me every time and uh every ni uh take my s uh phone he can for me every time and i can talk a lot program j and the second reason these that it 's sun is some thing that happened on me such as uh traffi uh uh the uh traffic accident or s uh all and then i can phone to the police or or my friends to help me
847,2,urn plants uh rain plants one of the ro hm rain forest plants has adaptation for living in rain forest uh first this plants a use another to re for uh exist thinks hm the first uh this plant uh attach to branch or trunk of to really and uh uh use the tree as support to survive net another uh adaptation to the condition in rain forest uh is unique shape of this plant unique shapes plants helps uh its plants to absorb water and nutrients uh this plants has lang leaves and um cold shape leaves uh then the uh it can um absorb more water single stamen uh another adaptation of this plants and uh ge unique uh hm
848,2,two ways that a product container can be to be designed to is uh to appeal to consumes is first making it user friendly for example before in the past uh uh li containers for ketchup and mustard were made out of glass jars using let when you need to use it you had to open the lead and wait for the uh ketchup or the mustard to come down by itself but by putting it the ketchup in a plastic container made it easier because you in easily squeeze the plastic containers and here comes the ketchup very easily and uh another uh another way of the the container appealing these making uh making get may have a pleasing appearance uh like a cookie uh boxes for example where people may use them when they have guests they want to be comfortable in displaying than in their house and uh they can be design
849,2,um the reason i want to read this book because i find ad attentive very appealing children i have read a lot of detective story and i can always did n't on grows into story completely the second reason that i want to read this book is for explain this book it comes to the reach the as a bible of the tight lives and it 's so famous that i do n't want to miss it finally lastly the last of doing that i want to use book is because of recommendation for my friend i have a lot of plants who have like book and the story suggest to me to
850,2,i think the chance to read a book that i have not uh i will read about science clocks because they are very important or they tell you a lot of information there were not from only west and you know sciences obvious see very essential in life uh if you know lot afar science uh looks very uh great and use a how how the other people look you and uh it will happy and schools and asked uh activities furthermore uh science you know is very a popular major is so if you if i get a chance would put have never uh read it sites books
851,2,first uh recently uh made up his own band and he has been practice for fill month and he 's ready to give a concert but the problem man is a the score it one is book is schedule for there are for for as perfo coming weeks s about that one inspire or his two options uh school internal has is opening next wednesday night but uh at four as a night it 's uh during the middle of week so he will have uh small art is and we can concer s but another option is uh he has uh he has a friend he you know the another band that would uh or world in to uh his band play a next saturday night but he will not he will not have uh he will not have to chance to play all of the songs that he has been practicing so our recommend displaying ones and i cause here are i would like uh he had he can play a lot of songs
852,2,has wrapped on a tree for a support um they ear and really had a willing nutrie uh her cannot be uh to get the sunlight and or the with the sunlight and they have spiky leaves and they gather nutrition from for the sentences um they store water from did uh roots from the tree and this is how they survive in the rain fo uh rain forest and this uh process or the how they the how the urn plant this uh relates see a fish epiph it how heron how it how they adapt to the life in the rain forest epiph it 's uh they 'll they also they behind the tree but the do not have access to the uh nutrition from the from uh from the plant the low they only have access to sunlight which is high them
853,2,um the searched are discussing about uh the time they can help they are concerts uh of the band and they have two solution one is to hold the cancers a during the middle of the week but there will be just little audience they 're based uh they have no time to go there and the the the other option is to have the concert on week but they have to use the auditorium with uh another perform group performance group uh but they uh they have just fill time to perform and my opinion i think uh they can uh perform with another group together because uh our weekends audi they will be more audience there and they can perform their uh packed songs and audience well like the sha because they can hear two kinds of music at the same time
854,2,i have a self but i would now out uh take it with me all the time because i i would like to have some mark private space private time and i think my mobile phone is much more like uh traditional phone someone whole me or give the message i will see and try like ce reach home or reach my house and then alcohol back or uh replied their message and i think cell phone yeah i uses that that why and i i was carry it one i have some emergency business
855,2,the proposal written by the student to the university is uh about advisor meeting uh is not our required she does n't i to does n't see the point because information is any on the website and uh it 's difficult to get uh early in the meeting between the advisor the student but the man does not agree to this in the talking part of the uh lect in of the thing he says that uh the website has very much less information compared to advisors advisors help them and not just some choosing subjects what and explaining are more the reading you another things also and scheduling meetings is not was that much of a proble a next you always lead she go early enough you can always get the scheduling on time so the man basically does n't agree he says that advisors are much more helpful
856,2,the book uh told like to read and have not to it read them very much interested in it is a book by bend cuts on called into big in this book he gives another t of leaves that only experiences as i am man devel with his korea and it have been toward that it is much waiting book to correct is names test to develop their pro fashions and work hard and uh less as it is a book that cut encourage an us a parent to prepare the ends that as uh devices need me as a parent of them starts work growing out wish to have
857,2,okay uh i do n't like very much cell phones uh so from tend to from time uh to time i'm agree with the cell phone with me but actually i left the form in my house becau i do n't like every and i do n't like this on everyone uh uh can find you everywhere you go even if you are in the bad fit and th everyone can find year so uh for me is not very good the cell phone my friends for example they they have they are cell phones all the time with them uh an okay they love that i do n't like that uh form is bir that way i love pre central quality
858,2,there are two other ways that i think the product container to be designed to appeal to customers one of them is to appeal to the to the classic part of the material it is made of for example if you use uh carton backs itself plastic backs you can say that they are more friendly environment and also i have a very clear example that they are they neg to choose that are mates in this all of the she 's a made out of problem recycled proper so that way you do n't have to uh expense so much money in materials that are not friendly environment also this ways can help or consumer be concerned be this inch price because they are going to be larger and they want care about what they are selling i also on the the ways that they use they say is that it is user friendly like the example containers they used for
859,2,in my case i want to read of da vinci code i and uh i have that lady uh on to now a po the person engine is it it does book the about the relation uh i am a christian so i will uh i really interested in relation about the to just uh is uh is this book about the relation so i want to read that book uh another reason is that my teacher lag the man recommend this book because he he is also christian but he after lady after he really did that this book she uh relaxed something test so i want to read this book
860,2,uh the new professor for the university talks about uh that 's spends of the meetings with advisors for they they degree every time just that they university their they 'd it the sep to to can select uh and it 's because of uh they uh all the information it 's supposed to be on the uh website of the university and uh student he does n't agree with this because he 's is that many times uh you really needed they had buys of an advisor surf that um because they usually have more more are ci extra information that they can help you to manage ju or uh such it on your degree and what you want to direct your uh study is to uh um also he says that uh he never had any problem with the schedules uh it was a busier lot rarely the people who was having those uh problems was probably cause they work just uh quite into the last minute to book that shadow with them place
861,2,since um steve is having a problem of um action having a they for their concert i believe if he gets to talk with the other cous of we she 's going to perform with at this propose the s uh weekend which they cannot afford because that that uh two deter and ro it 's fully booked they can uh actually she have a day instead of doing it on wednesday they can movie and all make a beautiful concept on a weekend where they give all they or anything so basically amount does advising uh and uh advising uh uh uh steve to actually um spreads his energy brought all week i am actually same that he should project energy that that use an wednesday and use it and is are uh on a weekend where they would be talking with the other uh where they will be doing to let the thing those other guys or in more committed
862,2,as it was mentioned in the listening passage urn plant has it is unique way of uh surviving and also uh uh if it types has this strategy that they developed for their survivals their wing in the host plants and by this way they uh they have access to the sunlight unfortunately they cannot uh get they cannot get the nutrients available from so hours but since there are trying to do that in their one way they had this interesting structure like the urn plant urn plant has a place where rain water collects in this in his in its leaves and then um by this way there is a bowl in their shape like bow structure and and all the water restore there and it becomes like liquid fertilizer and chemical breakdown an foods happens by this way just like the epiphyte
863,2,the man strongly disagrees if the students all light stating that uh it is not necessary to have an advisor uh first students because other information are on the website and uh uh the students are can find the information um in the conscious that they will argument is state uh he hard for this opinion other at uh the at least the advisor has extra informations and for example can nap you and if you want to find different place it can make planned and last oh the it is not their difficult to make an appointment because if he called to set up the appointment uh it will be easy for your but not if you come accurately that this point
864,2,some people like to uh bring the cell phone everywhere but i do not th i think that uh bring the cell phone at my uh she is not necessary because i do n't have many works to do with the cell phone uh i can contact with uh friends and uh my teachers on the internet uh furthermore the cell phone when we bring everywhere we could uh receive harmful effects such as uh um in the tend uh and uh it good and uh decrease our mind
865,2,i have not read harry porter series but i am interested in reading this book first helpul is the the most the popular books in the word for example my friends were always talk about harry porter when news series came more th second it made by movie usually good books say made by movie does for these reasons i would i'm interested in reading this book
866,2,i would prefer to have my cell phone with me at all times because the phone is there are is a she 'll in this information age we can do not of things doubt when you have them at hand at any time one of the importance of having phone around at all time is that you might want to she information other person want talked to is not along with the easiest and they fastest way to communicate is choose the form and emergency somebody wants talk to his now along ideal have phone then the information either get occurred uh anything like happen
867,2,the students in the li talked or the the university in and he asking them to uh to select remove or to like uh if they know their advise up for our uh ha ad advisor um both position or some negative and their uh be because there is there is all be site uh system um and everyone have access to use that and because the scheduling difficult to use hand uh his who they sh they should use the website and uh uh the man his he talking with the woman about uh about this uh proposal and he said is uh it 's uh she is good to it 's to speak with the advisor because he has and extra information and uh we can manage between different classes and their few calm and let that
868,2,cell phones has a cell phone or become a necessity uh in this modern times especially when you had to her call uh when when you are doing some business for example when whenever i go to uh meet some person tr it like business uh i now this causes before the appointments tree show that uh the guy is their at uh at the base but then again some uh cell phones th are also uh uh also a kind of problem because uh uh since uh because uh they ca they can interfere with their privacy and uh you cannot really enjoy your free time so i think
869,2,the man has recently showing uh uh musical band and they i getting are ready to have a costs it that uh they would like to have a concert in the campus all the told auditorium but the problem is they are uh looking for our some nice concerts then year but uh and fortunately adds movement they have n't had uh good schedule arrangement then the the camp campus auditorium is now through tree occupied in in the weekends until the summer vacation s s will starts so the uh the option is to have a concert on a wednesday ol to have a um i really recommend to
870,2,well the urn plant is his screen inches eq strange kind of plant cause it 's like a parasite cause it use are tree as host it 's not parasite cause is not having nutrients of that tree second they prefer they wo n't pla refer the upper plant the upper part that free all their which so they can have sun like and may be its name and other plants have this same mechanism of working so they have they leaves form a bowl stalk quite water the water in there is not just water to nutri the plant is just it 's water combined with something nails that forms a type of liquid fertilizer that the plant can consume every time she needs it so they are very well adapted troub eq forest because they these forest tight forest it 's rain a lo his training a lot during every time of the year almost
871,2,the speak girl so where discussing the problem of um give initial before the some so one of the speakers had um in a band he wou uh here was playing guitar and uh he thought that they where ready to have a concert and they wanted to give this concert in the campus hm they play rock like the pro they paid rock and also it would be really very him allowed uh so and and another problem was that uh old this ca lo the only with uh place they they can give give the uh the concert uh would be uh campus but uh no weekends but for wednesday so that 's why they need to decide till watch and should they do and uh one of their f friends um also had a band and they just um offer them do
872,2,the professor gives example of two type of wrong product containers which could be designed one one could be user friendly uh in the j uh uh dis convenient for the users to used in the product like uh let the ketchup and mayonnaise s or such attract came into last books says which bird difficult to handed all these like them got a spare the word while using now the come in squeeze plast containers which is which makes them moods easier to use the second one which professor talks about other boxes with giving a parent is like uh the example she gives is all phone cookie box it good to books could be design if um beautiful metal box or of a paper rocks and by presently requires it will be more good if you prevent a metal box
873,2,which class professor talks about how it with epiphytes uh add up to life in for rain forest and explain it uh by using the urn plant as an example he says that a urn plant uh surround the branches of the tree and uh use it as a host uh as a support uh to get the sunlight uh first um adaptation is ap shape uh urn plants ship uh is uh is such as uh bowl in which if there are stores water uh and the use it whenever it need and second is um uh it also forced uh deeply collect uh brought by insects and then the break down into the fertilizers and in this swim uh urn plant roots uh nutrient many where they need
874,2,according to the proposal mention in the letter there is no nee they need to meet advisors to decide about a courses and graduation requirements by the students the man disagree with the proposal mention in the letter he thinks that advisors are uh uh like person could discuss about the courses and uh improve uh uh think the related to graduation he says that students cannot uh uh her understand them information posted on the website and uh clearly this is the very primary and basic information they need to part with their advisor concrete in addition to that his he um thinks that scheduling an appointment with that weather is not a big bill uh and uh it is a pro above problematic with those student who read i uh until the last time or the last minute but if you schedule that are uh are are why uh the meeting with an advisor you can meet him where and decide abou
875,2,think the pre i have to see but i interesting to reading is harry potter um because i see the movie before or the harry potter is very good book and uh show as very interesting and the magic world and the in the sorry it 's very magic o and af an fantastic i think we can the very pare our always in the book and a we can use this so when very important pla uh problem in the uh in the normal or d
876,2,steve started a band and he wants to perform in the school are torn but there is no weekends about would perform so they want to perform with the other band friends and the allow them to perform before they do performing and but then they want have a lot of time to perform because those perform with another group so i think they should the she just practice just like one song perfectly and then perform want some profes be and in the night so they do n't of the practice summon songs that they can if they practice so many songs to carry their perform the most artiste i think they have to just practice one some perfectly and perform one song in the weekend concert
877,2,a container would be appealing to consumer if he was user friendly and convenient is so for example on time or ketchups she 's we and class um glass bottles but that sun which is unconvenient but now th they is plastic containers so it 's more attractive and audi to do is greece and it 's easier plasti use another way is a pleasing appearance so companies that 's or cookies can put them the nice metal box with pictures so they look nice when they 're presented to other people and they would beautiful and classy
878,2,i 'd rather not bring my cell phone with me all the time because uh some people are really again and they are always calling you um for example uh if i am in class or doing a presentation i wo n't be able to uh get that uh phone call and maybe in the hm the sound of my phone willing salute the the professor or myself if i'm is planning something to the class uh i i think uh mobile phones are really useful you can be um and people can know were do are attend uh every moment but that 's not something uh i want my life i want to be plea and i do n't want to depend some uh mobile phone every time
879,2,because of the tall trees in the in the forest and uh the tall canopy that he trades the this kind of plant uh uh to find a way to to get the sunlight and nutrients o uh with the example of the urn plant for example they they use the the tall trees as a host for example they can a rap the the roots around the trees to in order to get to the top the top various and from their or they can get uh this and she sunlight they need and but uh also the one thing to mention is that they do n't uh use nutrients water from the old plant so they had to find a way to collect water and the urn plant uh with the the call need shaped from the leaves can collect the water in the in a kind of bowl and it serves are also was um the sep tech for the the nutrients and that leaves i think that falls in it
880,2,i prefer to bring the cell phone with me all the times i think the best the cell phone is the one of the best invention in in our time and i ca n't it will well without him and i can use it to play games listen to music and down the or a lot of things i think is quite convenient for me to tad text message and cause a core prepared cause for to diary peoples i think uh people do n't like cell phone they do n't they can imagine how how good the life it 's with cell phone i think uh i can use cell phone to a lo lot or research and go to internet to learn a lot of things
881,2,in this uh material the writer of the but of the letter says that we should in many eliminate the advisor meeting because he thinks that the advisor advisor meeting is a waste of time and we can get everything on the university website but the man in the listening part uh he 's does n't quite does n't quite agree of course he has a lot of reason first he thinks the information on the website is an old quite a complete complete and advisor news no no advisors knows more extra information and they can help us secondly they think if uh it is not uh come and it is not disturb the schedule someone has problem has must have must uh must did n't do it just with until the dust time to said it 's or something up so the man agree of this
882,2,very good example often uh epiphytes is the urn plant which is very common and rain forest basically the urn plant takes the host plant as an announce support to grow its and and then a grabs at to branches that with that uh leaves so the and the leaves um and a boy she these leaves grant you know covers and time grea and it would also help them to like quite a lot of uh sunlight this bowl shape uh plan leaves help the water to grow loan it and an a water to the stu be stored and when every time there 's a rain with there 's a rain fall the water would directly fall on the leaves and the water is pr as uh and every time due to the insects ball on days of the there 's decomposition class and the speak composition help to greed micro ocean so this might which and would actually be released to the plants whenever
883,2,the proposal is all about advisory meeting should no longer required because uh they film that the students can go to the college website opt for different kinds of could go to s depending on their and cos however the man clearly is best buys that on the website there 's only a basic information however there might be few student should would require different kinds of uh assistance different ways and different uh style of uh no advising them and advisors towards thirdly help those kind of students to gather a lot of information and at the same time on the website there will be only a basic information however when they go and have a meeting with the advisor he work can some specific information better prod helpful for the students to opt for few courses and scheduling meetings is not at all uh difficult task unless and and then it is plant and announced moment hence advisor meetings what serving and with this
884,2,well in the proposal uh the uh advisor meeting uh would be cancer because uh students can get basic info on the website and they always have problems of adjusting the same free time to get to get uh uh between students and uh the at first uh advisors and the man in the conversation totally disagree with this opinion because uh yes students can get basic info on the website but the the advisors could help a lot could provide a lot of extra infor to the students for example if they want to know uh how to uh get a tree uh uh if they want to get some kind of her how can they get courses and second um students can easy to book book the schedule early uh a uh it 's uh if you get to good they early it 's easy to book
885,2,uh memory interested in the no novel is n't um forest come um because i can um know more about my action form the hm insects days tonight years um by appeal bores eyes such as the neck sh and and his portter gets can though and john in on and uh english invention uh and strong and the moon lending in a astronomy and the appea is and he is fashion and cultures and firstly and the rock can mo grow music i think i can learn more about american by reading this book um under the serve this um it also good he also a good thing to or to practice my english
886,2,hm the man me a problem that um his he 's pan um are ready to uh prepared for a ca n't concept but um tear to the re can ch um the re can when in the ad weekends they can birds uh will book so he was face a choice that um to to perform other on wednesday or at next week uh saturday with another bank i prefer to i prefer to um perform next saturday first of all um to to band will attract more more the peop more people than one um because um they have different friends and they will get together to enjoy the concept and secondly they can practice their um they are male second learn from another band deser good that 's a good way to improve their um ability so i i prefer to it second one
887,2,i will read about the book of living mean that because it 's of a very good i 'll ther proble a color and it sounds very good um he have his very interesting topics uh if she is books are were translate in fact at the plan wishes and i i have read al some books of product quite of like breed uh uh
888,2,well i would li uh have i would definitely would have i have a mobile phone with me because uh many of the time i have to travel from an placed one of the and it is convenient for me to keep a mobile phone with me so that i can have n't consid interaction with the people whenever they require something or when a i req or something and currently the f uh very of living of people these in very fast them may may meet some times they may not meet sometimes and mo mobile phone is a very good meet him uh from reason be in touch with many of the people some people may not like to have a mobile phone that is their opinion i would definitely like to have a mobile phone with me so that i can keep in touch with them and then uh require i need i can have have a help from doing mobile phone
889,2,the two ways that a product container design is maybe first by the uh uh design a box such uh which is user friendly and easy to access which will the container for the user to uh take some uh exam for example the ketchup box ketchup instead of having a uh ketchup and glass better new give in a plastic containers so that they can squeeze it out and uh use it and similarly for example a cookie box the other way uh is uh rather than having uh using the cookie box in a cardboard uh you 'll give them in a metal box with a building paintings and teachers and so that it look nice in the uh serving played and that if uh can also be use as a decorate is uh for a thing students these are the two at that is explained in does talk
890,2,hm i prefer to my cell phone or mobile phone with me at all the time the main advantage of doing so is that it helps me connected with all the people every down so in situations very in there are certain emergencies i can always be available for people people can be available from also advantage is that uh you we can we can keep or cell phones in a the silent mall or they can returned of in some important meetings or critical discussions so you can still receive a message is uh to which you can respond later so mobile phones also give an option of uh remaining uh and connected the times but uh in century people of the messages and you can stay connected and uh that helps
891,2,all the lecture is a mining talk about uh the two ways that a proud per products container can be designed to appeal to customers because for for um the first way is to make the container more use friendly because on that way could save cons customers time to use the products and for examples own for exams was about glass glass container for the ketchups is very un inconvenience for the customer to use that they long the change or plant plastics ke container for ketchups that attracts more people to buy it and the secondly it 's give in the container a bit for or like so that way when people present the get today our friend they can a film or proud so that 's the two ways
892,2,i think is is better to they kills cell or mobile phone we if you all the time because uh you know when some time u we can get some new jones colonies for example for those who apply for the job they uh they this they 're both concur them ask at any time so they like take their phones with them and to be spends to the co so i think is very important to to have your cold they few so at any time you will be which and get some news on of by the and mad but it think he 's those wide their cell phone if they are my do n't need down when we are in the public place but easily interesting to have your cell phone we if you for that was n't as a must n't before it
893,2,uh in lie can actual for actually for me i cannot with of a cell phone uh from all day because if i go um uh have a cell phone with me i feel um are comfortable and feel will abou every in um i think cell phone is good fir bring all time first you can come take your friend our family easily and their friend can hear friend of family can even to get uh to find you and quake where you are and also so they have a last and they can get and then i feel boring some on i also can spend some uh with that there is a phone so i prefer to have cell phone with me all the time
894,2,i would like to tell take my mobile phone everywhere i wa i girl cause it 's convenient get if i have the phone someone can commit at any time and i can contact with someone else at any time they want and also for emergent see thinks can some interest give me court and i can respond as soon as possible if i do not have the phone i i ke will be worry about um was going on things and we shy do and what cry do or if anyone want find so phone is very and part for me so some people i think just just do n't want to be distract by the phone so they choose to not taken from but i would like to take phone with me i need time
895,2,um normally these days i'm interested in chinese preparation test book um because i'm i'm interesting learning chinese is n't um a been teaching and it it was really grateful to explore the city but i could n't speak anything nice and i could n't listened any any change letter so um so that 's why i interested then learning chinese and i found this change textbook they really really want to buy and learning et well um another thing is japanese text book as well that um and more interested in chinese text book uh
896,2,in the lecture the professor discuss about a container up the product which should be designed to appeal to consumer um she give two example far that the uh for his uh for her opinion the first example is have a the first uh met uh is to make um pro the container product more a more friendly to use it 's main unlike up a company which uh produce ketchup uh they put the ketchup on the plastic container so that a consumer is easy to use it um before uh the old type up the container of ketchup is have to pour have to relieve the late before they or it on the food nowaday only just late or the ketchup on the food is uh convenient for them and decide to make the uh the second is to make a container more precent this main more a pity phone
897,2,most of the term the professor ver not buy the products uh only because of the cell but because of the appearance of it uh so the design is very important so in this passage it shows two ways that a producers container can be designed to appeal the customers the first goal is to uh design it 's conveniently friendly um there are a lot of uh comedies like a ketchup or like ketchup yeah ketchup and because in in the in the past uh in the former ways and the ketchup would uh uh designed uh in something that very hard to get um people need to school through out the things screw out the things and uh uh most of the time you will be a man and uh if they if they uh design it in a flexible ways they would uh s crisis to like uh the the the customer will like it better and the second uh second goal is
898,2,the book that i really want to read is to solve than leaks and the say i like to read it because it ground to the scientific s scientific fiction in scientific fiction we can also find that plot and the libraries offer you 'll be bad attracting re ever i be ca n't read i ca n't have reading it film reading it as soon as possible and sometime you may fun that he will you will never know what will happen in the next chat or until you read it and in the two saw the makes under the say we can find some talk uh some pre concer of the scientific discoveries uh for example we can find the s a woma rain in the two sunday leaks under the sea it conce block my imaginations
899,2,i'm asked to to do with to to choose what type of person my mind if i need to take my cell phone everywhere at all times or ste leave it at home or or in the when the car you see i am a doctor and as a doctor unnecessary gen maybe i have to confront emergencies and such a were this is nice and it 's me always need to be connected so i have to take my cell phone everywhere get that can be but geisha 's that can be uh the be it can be everywhere because i need meet always to be connected because i ca n't get energ in call and go to the operate room in no time so that 's why
900,2,first we 're asked to do talk uh or read about the students news paper and tell so is in the letter that he thinks that advisors do n't they do n't be needed to to meet uh addi uh before the beginner on the semester because all they infor that they can get is available in the internet and he also thinks that is this is not necessary because both the student advisor it needs free time to to to to get uh to get to get communicated so two students are talking about this and one is uh stand the other that he does n't agree with the letter because advisors can give you so much but more more information than the than the wet can give you and they can give the some t incentive s and the make you life is her and also uh when they should n't uh settle uh the appointment on time and not at the at the end or they gain and of the semester
901,2,the reading passage mainly about epiphytes which he uh which is a won kinds of urn plant uh that use a host plant for close to get nutritions and the sunlight to grow uh in the up um since uh the canopy uh sees since get the canopy in the rain forest or more uh on more likely to to not to to not have any to not have any chance to grow up um their own bu urn plant to use the uh it 's uh it has unique uh characteristic such as a it 's flower is in single stem and they uh they they they the contain the uh they collect the water resource a by having a steve and the long uh leaf and uh and the if the rain comes down the the water research wars down to the to his uh to make to be the we kid to fertilize for the trees self
902,2,um the conversation is many about the opinion uh advisor meeting should not be required did n't uh before the beginning of the semester uh which the which e help student to to select to their course and advice about the courses and uh this is because it 's every information is already on the website and it is difficult to schedule with the professor however the man disagrees with the plan with the reasons below firstly the website uh the website is information is not enough for the for the student uh such as they can they need to more they need more information for the graduation or different classes are from uh for their study secondly um this uh he disa was with dor opinion that uh the it is difficult to schedule with the prefer at with the advisors since uh he never experience to that if the want to go they are all lead to schedule uh it will be open
903,2,i would like to read the book named my japanese life i'm interested to read this book because the title some very interesting and uh uh and in the movie by a promising is also in the meeting for this for all over this book and above all i was in japan for quite some time and the history in cultural japan is quite introduced me and that makes me quite into student book so what what what are the qualities of could japanese life and how can uh these book put me more insight about ch band moreover there are managed other short stories in this as well which things sounds very interesting to me
904,2,epiphytes plants which grow under the canopy of dense trees and they take those dance trees as host eighties now urn plants they the take the help of other trees uh they wrap up on the branches and on the clients and um they uh they be hold their leaves in await so as to collect waters and when must get those and another of uh elements fall into it they decompose and form are very new nitrogen reach nutrients in a similar way the epiphyte when they go about the host takes it help of the host trees they get sunlight from of the trees and they get they get nitrogen rich compliments forty group from the similar uh water and decompose might root in my other animals and plants
905,2,uh the two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers are by first uh ma uh by making it user friendly um we can uh such as plastic containers for ketchup or mayonnaise or mustard um their plastic uh um has before used to being glass which is my c view it use a spoon or uh for a ke to just put a take of the hm the sauce and if would be messy uh but now since her using the plastic containers which is the lid it 's faster and easier to other uh way is by making it a pleasing appearance so com uh customers uh would feel comfortable to present it at at their home uh f to guests so we can decorate the cookie box or such as that
906,2,first steam onto abolish me teens with university academic advis start reach ten this makes space to he 'll to the students bet every of which course to select and to informed on graduation requirements have the letter states that is also possible on the web so they 've several difficult to find met uh schedule meeting the steam does not green day he says the basic info is on the web so i have extra information still requi you ca n't see academic ca n't in addition he net have problems chatting you prof meeting negatively devise he 's just call early and to to live at must need it to be scheduling a prep meeting they ruled the student strongly disagrees with the letter the as be publish the did agree newspaper he thinks that the mandatory and unnecessary and benefit the student
907,2,one way that hm a product container can be designed is that um uh you 'll have for example instead of hm a class contains uh plastic contain the make that flexible and comfortable further user and um you have to hm created friendly as possible for it it um the um all a way that a prop attracts container can be designed is um that you make the contain dairy nice for for example guest way uh who um are meeting you and it 's um very attractive for them so they will buy it maybe as well and they would at a very nice impression op it
908,2,because epiphytes uh these plants not able to get sunlight uh if if were these but this plant uh after a special mechanism to to get sunlight uh and then on the usual larger trees who like to the uh mary gather be uh over the pro uh this uh plants can doubt of a p to thirty to forty meters above the gro the problem is they do n't get enough nutrients because they do n't take it from the host tree so they ha then develop a new should be get is uh to do so uh it for the example urn plant water does is it to use it only it it 's spike the stu we get uh goal they shape which is which uh use the ch was that they could store water it also stores and it 's a tra uh tried leaves
909,2,urn plant is an example and how if students have adopt to life in the rain forest uh um friends um they uh they grow the room uh you know to other trees so they they write on the trees to survive uh urn plant have uh long and uh huge leaves the uh their leaves grow into our cone shape so you can stores as much water or energy has the want uh after the rain the rain uh force into the bowl when the the story these are the stored in their leaves uh uh afte uh they can u use it wou whenever they want uh that 's how the pro plans uh survive in the rain forest
910,2,the letters comes from a student that does n't want to meet uh with the re tutor because he does n't have time and the information is all the stated in the website there is other student who is discussing this with the woman does n't agree because he says that the basic information is in the web that if you go and talk to someone he really can or she really can give you an advice which is they think that you need to choose their classes and you and to decide which is the most convenient subject that you have to take the time is n't uh problem for him it 's enough and he has not always any never had a problem with that
911,2,speaker explain the concept of epiphytes by using the example of the urn plants uh urn plants has unique shape so it can it can store the water and and it can sto the war and it to trump is very wide to store the water and nutrients so so uh in the rain forest uh this plants can adapt adapt she environment is and also uh there are uh other nutrients sources such as insects and other de case plants uh those insects sen plants uh i usually going to decompose so this decayed nutrients can flow into the urn plant so it can be
912,2,urn plant the using of that first to suit itself but uh take nutrition from insect spend uh other this like to for their uh for their uh for that self them for uh uh there are of lower to make the sep take them and store the water and storm are more number of nutrients and then after the from more number of sector attracted towards the foo uh their flow also it characters and take the new transport uh uh gets the uh arms plant epiphytes are uh by other tells auditory type of parasite which grow on other plants and take the nutrition from that plants and uh uh does n't know it it takes only hear from the uh uh from the it will environment and uh take the food as into the but do not uh make uh food itself they 're it take food from uh host plant and but also uh take nutrients from the host plant uh it 's so as a fight is mentally uh pad aside did plan
913,2,in this set of material the reading passage woods inte thing words what some details how in fight have adapted to life in the rain forest furthermore the listening passage in the place is the same the sea mentioned idea with example find house such adap adaptation to to place the uh urn plants are an example of uh in the fight they they wrap their roots around the tree they especially the trunk of the tree they use tree for support they have long uh stiff spiky leaves which which help them uh uh
914,2,i would like to bring my cell phone the time if i have cell phone because i one of one of my reason is emergency uh if you have or if i have emergency have to common my parents or my call teens but if i do n't have a cell phone i really like cannot handle my emergency situation so that 's one of the reason and the second second reason is the pay he pay pay for the public so if i do n't have uh likes a fo a cell phone the tree or like public place are to like bar some film or have to pay the phone to like call someone so uh that 's very much but my opinions yeah
915,2,uh the professor recommended two way is the couple ways to of tell the customers the first one was the the the making the plasti with pa uh using the pla plastic to with the to put in the taught products because the the problem was when the products of made by the glass there are a lot of problems dutch lectures a lot problems it the customer spill the products like on the table on the on the four because they really is can be really mess avai really like teengers for kids or like other other peoples so if they made by the plastic it 's really useful and does n't have to care about like messing of the for or cleaning really like like spend a lot last times and the second was second second when i was the by the given but the really could design on the product really looks classic and appeal to customers really easily so
916,2,when a customer and take a product he does n't buy the product and but also buy the container and so the design of the containers very important for uh attracting the year the customer potential customer to buy it 's the product um there are two ways to uh to a child people uh from the container firs uh to make the container uh a convenient to use um for example the um flexible um plastic container for ketchup uh is a uh easier for for their customers to screens the ketchup and second way is to um decorate the the container for um looking nice um for example the cookie box uh is through the for it the bird to
917,2,well the profess states that it it fi it 's i plants adapt to the life in the rain forest they use the host plant as a platform for group can cannot kind of po uh this kind of f uh this climb te uh to platform is attach to ch lead to have access to sunlight but they are ant uh no nutrients from the soil below swar day at developed my uh mechanisms to sur does is a problem so they have the bowl uh leaves that goal lecturing and the insects and decomposes them producing night the materials what nutrients to survive in addition wraps its roots around the branches or trunk reside own canopy also they have a special finals she that help them and feeding
918,2,although i prefer to uh novels would uh mysterious or mysterious this but the one nobody want to read stu state budget another problem me uh may because he 's they renowned fi writer and uh i have never any any they both before beside about that is presently reading a book and as given a good feedback the family reason i want to go to the book because writers application and is
919,2,the container of the product uh can be designed to make uh user friendly in convenient uh for using can be attract appeal to the cust consumers the uh example is given at the lecture uh is uh the ketchup bottle is now used in plastic instead of a glass bottle which can poured uh easily by squeezing the that instead about uh conver some usage of the bottle the second uh way to make a pra the container appeal to the consumer is making a pleasing look like a cookie box is in a metal teen uh help with uh the pretty picture so they can serve it with uh the pleasing look on the
920,2,well to think have a book that i have the read but me interested in reading i first thing about harry potter because i do n't have so much to to spend on reading so i always spend so i was what the s film on the cinema i think this book must be very magics and i think this ca must be very magic an interesting or it cannot be the best seller in the book stores and and i want to read that bird that diction the author chooses to describe the fantastic life harry potter 's spend with his friends i think there must be some difference between the books and uh films i want to discover the
921,2,the man is in trouble because he want to do the concert next weeks but to hold the campus auditorium is already booked so the man and the woman discuss two possible solution to the problem they 're first option is to make appointment and the next wednesday night and the second option is to the concert together with the other bands which when they next saturday i think the first option is much better than the second one because most of the concer years i heard on the the weekend but teach doing the concert on the middle of the week with with even phone i think because there is very unique thing another reason is that i think if they are doing concer with the other band together then uh the people my even hard to remember his his even name of the band
922,2,a kill the becau passage of this some bowl the sun does n't really with the letter and uh is is very very well unlike uh tired all the time refers universi i would like to read this book because it was all the books uh for my favorite authors and soul perfect and advi for him he has in the me think amazing quality of reading is book diff very addicted yet going finished one one day it 's it 's a very easy book to read but it 's it 's a good long it is because uh clubs
923,2,the man believes that advisor misses should be canceled and to do n't damage required because believes that all the information which are causing for these things uh are available on the website however the man believes that is opinion uh proposal is very or he believes that the lecturers and advisors this learn advisors know the best about the uh graduation requirements and to recycle contest basic information therefore it 's been importance to meet with the academic advisors so that 's i able to give the students information which might not evil have on the website secondly he believes that scheduling which is with academic advisors is not asked difficult asked the man is make its a thing he believes that only people home only people who i late and have an are going to the meeting is very will it other was the have the problem of students of debts in appointments with that 's went advisors
924,2,the letter is pref about the advisor meeting should no longer be compulsory um because um all the information the students me is art e at the stu uh website and um second me it is hard to arrange the schedule between the student and the advisors um the man does not like this idea uh in the meeting should not be compulsory because um he does not think that the information in the website is um appropriate for students to make a decisions um he thinks the the the information on the website all uh only basic we informations and um studen might need different information to make a good this it 's and and secondly does not think that um if students be and time then they would not be of high time to arrange skin schedule between the advisor and the strict
925,2,um i think i have not it create but i am interesting what boredom interested in is so harry potter uh that was that there are two reasons why the first reason is that uh i heard that that i heard that this bul was so interesting and another reason is that uh it is a best seller so i think uh it means uh uh very fun to me to
926,2,the problem problem that the man has is that uh because the campus auditorium is because uh they have own new one option to open their cause the next wednesday uh and they also have another options to do n't for the concert which is uh performing with other next saturday and i recommend to uh the band d and his band should play their music with other band next saturday uh it is because uh d next saturday would be uh there will be many people in the concert and it would be good to let people know about the band d
927,2,i prefer to bring my cell phone first of all um so is very convenient even though i i faced emergence a family majors time i can know by um by by the have think cell phone and i i can gives text messages to my friends hm where uh where i live in um and second reason is i can webs or pin fi using cell phone and i check my e mail hm cell phone and if or i like to uh ro ground shopping more in online and i i will buy some food uh some food or clothes
928,2,in my case i ample they have not read but are interested in reading was uh book of of one month there are several reasons why first of all it was very expensive for me where i mean is because i will uh high school student at the time hm i did n't have enough money to buy the books uh although the obama was my favorite purse animal life hm like could n't hm by the book so a book that i have not read but was interested in reading is op the woman of po
929,2,no uh i prefer to the have my mobile phone all the time with me cause he she humble phone is uh almost like my own life it and helps me to stay in touch with my friends and parents uh moreover uh i use it in my work a lot uh he see and working at computer science and very often i need to uh can have th with uh some peoples uh uh ha know much more that are uh so it really helps me in all my life uh
930,2,plants adapted to reduce conditions uh like uh rain forest and so on uh well uh the exam one example of plants uh is and the fights hm uh they live in the shady and ground uh and um um uh for example the urn plant uh uh uh adapts uh in the rain forest first using it 's uh branches it wraps around the trees so it helps he it helps it uh to reach the sun the science and urn plants uh have uh spiky least to collect water and store uh um tomorrow that they can the other water ant and creation is uh the nutrition they get from in sings an leaves uh uh that they catchy in their leaves
931,2,uh i think that um uh caring uh your uh mobile phone with few weeks uh a better idea for few reasons first reason is that if you have your from uh uh more your mobile phone with few you can a contact the your friends or family or you 'll code water he for there is uh in the emergency uh second reason his that the uh if you have your home uh your cell phone with few you can in bec contact you actor in uh by um uh anyone who has your are number uh if uh that person uh wants to
932,2,the article talks about epiphyte which the passage describes as a plans this he use uh uh other plants as a platform to grow uh g uh lecture uh provide example and this uh the example of a urn plant in order to illustrate it is um a type of a plant the urn plant uh uses that and the other tree as a suppor by listening et a the food from the search worry resides up in a clea it has some s uh adaptations it has long le leaves which are overlaps and the create a sort of receptacle uh which uh a store the both all water but also nutrient hm uh the cell or water together in these nutrients create a sort of uh uh fertilizer me uh which can be use uh uh by the plant uh uh as a food
933,2,well the problem since that they they guys have to do the concert before the summer because there wo n't be people watching and the summer and they also can do it in the letter weeks because the the the the uh because they ca n't get into the auditorium because it 's booked for the letter weeks and they also have from uh lots of songs to do and they also have to do it in wednesday the coming wednesday that they have well i think uh if they had you know in uh uh present uh less sons and prepared for uh two or three sons that would be great and that would give them more time to prepare for this coming wednesday and so i do n't think they would have any problem while preparing fee is this uh little sons
934,2,well i fights have adapted um ways to live in rain forest such as hanging uh above um uh i mean on the track on the trunk of trees to get sunlight and some of them stick to tree trees but not get nutrients out of it and take nutrients from ground levels and some other uh some other apply it um uh have leaves that are cone shaped to collect water and some other have flies hers uh make wall tra fer fertilizers to feed of letter well uh uh these examples um of epiphytes have um adapted so they could live and rain rain forest
935,2,well as the letter uh clearly states that students should not meet would advisors because all the information are note it on the website the guy said uh and stated as his opinion that student um must seek uh further advice after reading basic information because some students acquire uh information that that is uh give a not face to face and to figure out their further education and also students should as he stated student should also uh try to see uh advisors in time that more students wo n't schedule so the there earlier the better as he stated
936,2,the containers must be useful for example in it it maybe ca n't up the past year just for uh class containers which you need to use it we had to trade on top of the uh the top so that can get it ca n't admission they have missed the plastic profits which may you need to squeeze to squeeze to get you ca n't up and like so so it but it 's als he is to use container there is a friendly so uh what students come to the letter a a pleasing and looking parent in looking like a con these are j it would be tells u you to view on to a rock we uh we uh contai mates cons consumption of this waste to maybe the some well or and is
937,2,in the proposal is says let 's eliminate the meeting time advisor before the class starts the reasons are that every things on the website so no one people have can just like on the website and find out what they need and sometime someone might have time conflict with scheduling the meeting with advisors but the man says he does not agree with the proposal because the advisors no more than website and someone they can have the um find another or to graduate or meet the their retirement and advisors give they know better than the website and they have their opinions and the second reason is that he never had um time conflict to see the advisor if someone can hurry a pen schedule their napkin have the problem
938,2,i will ordering my cell phone and the time first first first of all i can company can with my friends and family or the time to be specific even when i go summer far away from my school or home i cast tell sh or my stories rain with them conveniently um by keeping keeping in tells read them i would n't be lonely her stone with when cell phone might come uh i can do many kind of other i can use uh other kinds of functions for example i can take pictures wra cell phone play woman something on expected help month uh and additional that i can listen to the music uh the time
939,2,the book i have not read but i interest in reading is the bird ner purpose you read the got the ch because many people around me and many of my friends and my family has uh read this book and told beat it really interesting book and also i like printer very very much other wet almost most of this books but because i had uh that 's time does this one second out read uh is new book though the got there for a fight uh time i want to read a his uh book got a caught because it has always that some ice than one book and like and he has also fiction of his salt in uh of other books um one book cause the caught
940,2,i prefer to have cell phone with me all all the times because it 's main purposes actually uh the to uh bring anywhere uh bring anywhere you go with that and it it that 's why it is called portable telephone and also uh you can call anyone in any time he uh incase of emergency and inches so or something urgent you can call cause the cell phone uh any time but if you do n't have if you might have uh bec in efficiency and like be problem and also it has a lot of early a lot of uh tech where machine is in the support for example this culturally this culture later and there is uh there is the dictionaries and there are also other facilities they can use with the cell phone
941,2,the man 's problem is that since his roommate is moving out he has problems in going to campus two possible solutions are given by the woman to handle this pretty could n't first she suggest that he can take public transportation second is that he could go back to his dormitory and the since he wants to live alone she suggest that there are many single required rooms that he can use if i were him i would take public transportation because it is much cheaper even though there are no buses are find other solution to solve by problem living dormitory i he 'd it so i prefer taking public transportation to going back to the dormitory even though there is a single room that i can leave
942,2,the lecture is about in the rock and uh the earth surface uh me which uh which is a of a terrible effected by the temperature changes water and wait is better that the the weathering weathering is the concept of breaking of rock into the smaller pieces his called as weathering number one first example of weathering is water water go inside the cracks of the rock and and forth some day does it freezes the water and it cracks becomes larger and larger and it breaks the grows into the pieces second example is plant seed implanted gives uh fall into the crack the plant grows from the seed and root causes the crack an ro become bigger and bigger and it cracks into the pieces of rock
943,2,a co uh well uh were library bec the glare the changing limitation uh found and allows to eighty weeks and then must student it is good by they however uh female student does n't agree with that because to finish reading is does or take such a long time uh two weeks is a gave but wi use a ride uh work out it with need much more time to a prefer per reference so uh it should n't be changes for two weeks because it 's too hard to finish prof uh just within two way and she refers also be using into loudly loan still a very and they can get any
944,2,uh i agree the idea the be have uh be go shopping for pleasures um for is uh for first then uh by going to shopping for pleasure we can roll lectures uh a visual usually get stresses because uh we spend most of time studying working and by um shopping for pleasure we can uh relive per stresses uh the soup even to very beneficial for me because i can work uh more efficiently in the hm ordinary days and secondly uh shopping for pleasure may be a good uh method of the entertaining um we can uh go for shopping with her friends and
945,2,the friendly uh the environment friendly business practices could benefit not only the environment but also the the business it 's self um first it could help save money hm a could cut down the operative cost um for example the only g uh the energy used and in the light bulbs hm could be cut down if the light bulbs could be change to a special current and this will the energy of light bulb will last longer and when you will save some money for the for for the business on the electricity and another important fact is that those business looks more attractive to consumers because the conce consumer will become more positive about this business and the they would like to spend money on such kind of business because they use napkins and cups um made up recycle of with recycle papers
946,2,um i like to go shopping i prefer to go shopping um only for sh plants for special purposes or special purchases um i do not enjoy shop i do not enjoy hm i do not enjoy shopping in my free time or my leisure time it 's something uh i i feel it 's uh something i think of that i need something uh but the s um and exhausting to me i am the one was to charact get to carry the backs and um mostly abi uh of by a internet because it 's uh much more easy and comfortable added of have talk
947,2,uh uh in the listening materials the professor describes uh uh topic on the business class according to the professor more and more people realize that uh there are important role to protect nature such as th atmosphere around us and uh more and more copies are running business to protect uh the environment such as preserving uh natural resources at the benefits is that uh by doing this can save a lot of money um of the company such as um use there 's a bird special lack boxed to reduce the energy uh use you know every ca uh many companies spend a lot of money and electronic uh uses uh at if the compli uh do this it will attract the cons uh the customers uh more concern of the protecting environment coffee shop is a good examples they you
948,2,the paper and the lecturer uh discuss and discuss a swarm intelligence uh for example ants live in a colony and they use uh they are uh their colony uh to get to their food and uh such as uh to get the food uh uh if if when there is a space between is friendly the way that the food uh ants you to their body is that the if you they make uh bridges uh for instance uh one ants uh extended their uh i it body and uh and the next ant uh book on the ant and so on uh this makes uh ants uh get food eat their than they
949,2,i would parents should be booked the process of helping their children to choose a university because uh he d uh the parents is uh they uh the well known about uh his their children so he they ca n't help they right choice of that their children 's uh subject and the other reason is that they have o already experienced attacked kind of process so they can uh give uh correct advice to their children to choose the right uh university uh the to these two
950,2,the first reason is by the first reason is when it what when water pressed when the rock press about so what flow the water it 's case crack uh when you get pract what that now settle inside it and attend it reasons by the time by night it 's time last and is that get uh uh it gave that one reason when they 're when the when the root the water also get cry and this can um with an sit kind it ca n't get into style germinate in and that ways that the meeting to rules now who down to the for water and nutrients that is the reason why attend to see some trees green on rocks and this those trees when they get began they now break the rock into two their best when they would do not get down to do the soil get water and nutrients it 's
951,2,swarm intelligence is the please simple action of single individual insects working together as a group resulting in a complex behavior that le the let the example from the lecture the illustrates the com concept of swarm intelligence was that ants colony moving together for for the food sources for example there maybe a get between tree branches for ants to cook class when they want to reach the food for the survival so ants can form month bridge between the get from one side to another by a simple action of holding tall land with their back legs and another ants going a class that ant and holding the hole in holding on the ants ant so it 's uh repetition of simple action of individual insects however you can conclude with ants colonies at sitting in in which living the food from where they want to get it
952,2,well for me is a girl the questions pretty easy to answer because of course a like shopping and um i like shopping because they did n't spi or just watching a close an like fashion so um yeah i always going to be up to date when it comes to fashion but i can also understand weigh some people do not like shopping specially boy is because will fashions to s not that because idea and can be knowing to like being stores the really crowded and looking for sizes and everything but the as a girl shopping of courses the best d d
953,2,in this set of materials the reading passage is a passage of a si will naughty text book the listening passage is uh uh class the reading passage says that describes culture lag uh th uh and adjusting of technical change so the listening passage on the other and says that is explanation of the concept of cultural lag um by the telephone first says that business used telephone because people dislike not to visit someone and uh saying that it is rude just to call someone so there is a major characteristic of cultural lag because subsequently over a period of thirty years also the and people accepted the to the sun and now every p on depend on to in conclusion listen passage
954,2,um personally i prefer to enjoy shopping and shop only one uh l i have a a special which is to make uh have two reasons for holding is opinion first of all it is a waste our time to go shopping pro period because in uh in your conserving preparing a when uh walk uh when the new and then to the show which would market uh i um have been unnecessary when listening many uh which you can be use to study a personal uh go shopping prepare is was and many will go to shopping prepare you 're you meet buy something in the room leader and uh such as the sun and actually provi reasons i prefer to go shopping uh woman one on i have uh purpose has also
955,2,in the listening material the woman has a problem uh add out um whether she should go to the test the review class or to go to the retirement part party and uh the the the man provide two possible solutions uh the first is that uh the man can attend the class for the woman and the second is that he could give the materials that uh prepare the by the woman to the students as th adds to myself i would prefer the first choice because and as the students have studies the study the class for whole cheering that they can review the uh the class themselves the size as uh i 'd in love materials uh can be afford it and can be provided it and uh other use no problem for them to revise the class
956,2,in my opinion i think parents should be involved in the process uh for helping their child to choose the university uh for the following two reasons first i think parents has no experience to help us to choose our uh university uh second i believe that uh uh parents can give us some advise that way he may not uh uh we may not of doubt about is a good uh four hours to choose a our university our university because is uh uh big thing for uh our cell phone and uh also pick the infor families
957,2,uh i can my a bring myself to admire are the actress queue year care and i do his work uh for one day he uh she always gets the big role like a leads a bad ben at from the um worked famous novel help pride than pract to th eyes or the adoption is uh for um the why uh famous um night nineties century in with the writ is can them by her actors a kind of al always kane and um i can uh always um see that uh fire in the work about other um great actresses
958,2,uh the lecture says uh that there are uh two ways of weathering he one of them is uh uh water in the rocks uh and the other one is plans in uh the rocks uh the first one uh is occurred that way uh one water sh goes into the rocks and uh at night uh the man temperatures decrease the water freezes and ex past in size uh so uh it let 's the rock uh uh break down in small pieces the second one uh is uh a man uh plants uh roots grow uh be ants to grow done uh they cause to rocks break down in smaller pieces uh also uh three roots searching forced uh water and nutrients uh makes rock uh become smaller pieces
959,2,the university decides to organize they uh two ceremonies uh for the student to receive their diplomas uh they did this for two reason the first is that there are too many students uh ask consequently the ceremony takes too long and this the second reason is that the hall that the ceremony takes place it 's too small the woman uh gives uh solutions uh for those reason for for for those reasons uh for the uh first which is the great number of students says that uh uh uh they should reduce uh the number of speeches and um this will reduce that uh the number speeches so the time with take long and for the second promising this as whole but the number of guest that it should have has tie and uh invite source propose the reduction and they are of the guest for it the student
960,2,uh so it 's call like uh in the passage is swarms uh it 's like a group of insects are like building the sex uh when uh an a swarms are and the insects can have like they only intelligence that ca n't need and than by individual uh for example like ants uh we should live in the colonies they move together to art uh the food source uh while they are doing that uh they may find an obstacle for example like in a tree uh the would go to uh branch with food source but uh in the journey day find wide space within the branch so the solution is uh the first an work to work that would the branch to the end of the branch and he the hold with it back likes uh stretch their body forward and the second ants do the same and they 'll it reach the end of the branch so i gets a breaks or a chain of insects of and so they could reach the food source
961,2,uh there was a popular actor called action young and i 've at first i liked is a movie an is th romans that it was storing and but uh uh after her that he uh wanted to reasons our raise when it was uh bad economy then i began to think that he work those th romans and start in movies because he wanted money not just because he wanted to story those very artist good artist clea good movies so i i came to not admire his worked
962,2,they should is about swarm intelligence um swarm intelligen s about how ol an can insect um a complete completely special task and they can accomplish a special test only to get the in swarms and uh the two according to the professor um he um and it describe ants as colonies for food uh for to find the food source for example they come on trees but there wide space between the different branch on it he said how they solve this problem um they will build a bridge between the branches and so they can reach uh the next branch to um surf source of new food or or or
963,2,in the conversation the woman has a problem about um he has a important the class uh to uh at four o'clock tomorrow and at the same time he is cousin 's party will begin at four o'clock too and the man gives her one solution and and that uh he can cars her class and the second solution was said by the woman 's he herself he can go to the class first and then go to the party and as far as i a concerned i think the first solution is better and because uh hm the woman do n't want to um avoid the his cousin 's interesting speech and also the man the man professor has a good ability to cover here her the review class and uh also the man can use the material which which are assigned by the woman 's so uh it 's good for it 's good for her cousin of for herself and his student with good for the test also
964,2,well s more intelligence mains each effect uh act a simple behavior and the writ paid it and finally a complex behavior can be accomplished uh and is and excellent example because one day f uh face some talk f tasks uh uh like they need to cross branch to reach food um first uh uh ant old the work falls to the end of the branch then another ant uh stress as stress the first ant 's body and the right across the first ant 's body um and this movement uh repeated one after the other and to they could connected the branch on the other side of the open space hm this movement allow the rest of the ant uh to across the animal to across the former ants s body and the finally they could reach reach the food
965,2,has a large advice uh her uh downloading reading material with uh raw which will be useful for the stu uh the boy the price of this uh device is taught two thousand two hundred dollar and once they one should download but is this device for one for ones at the time and it will save uh the uh practicing uh many books and with him uh with using only one device uh i want can download to the reading written but it is as uh the the student another th uh the other way uh does n't agree with this uh plan he he 's he 's tells to start with this plan because uh he 's uh she told about that d uh that that the that that of new techniques new who device uh the people can change and the real price of it is high idea and another is uh the devi should be d should bef it easy use d
966,2,decide to think that parents should involve the process of helping other helping us to choose a university because when i was in high school i do n't have enough time to search the information about the university is because i need to study for her the whole day long and uh after wo our discussion they know what i want to do that and they know what is my interest and then they could do the research for me and they gain miss some suggestions so i do think that if the parents ke to do that from me there will be very helpful and i will help fully choose uh better university for me
967,2,to perf rather what this cau brings announces schedule because nancy has attracts gap schedule conflict and have for o'clock nancy will have the poetry class and it mean while he will have a party in to for clock to he do n't he want to she want to go to the party but she also do n't want to meet the class for his two students and there 's a man it 's profes the man professor talk talk he was free part for crack tomorrow and eat nancy nece of like he which he could he could teach the students and instead of her because he talk to poetry for said the several years and you could do their while the nancy think uh he she would to prepare the class his who herself because she think that is good for a student his students uh
968,2,a kid the lecture was about uh limited borrowing period for the library the first one is uh that the student throat in this letter that uh uh some people old uh far uh to sunlight before one month and they should th written at four uh to s because a second trades that can find was talking about uh that uh another structure they might need the it 's talk and bigger was the or disagreed with this letter because the first point uh the uh made he need for one mo month for uh to get differences from uh to talk and the second time that uh uh she can get it from the library and or the or the point filling form in the library in with with it from the be after uh library
969,2,the university 's plan is still replace old books with electronic books um big they the reason is that they uh want to students to the f money uh may have to pay want time to down do uh su two hundred dollars and um then you have all books an can down lot all the books you will uh you need um the were woman 's opinion is that she do n't like the new electronic books she a like the uh old traditional books because um she think it 's too expensive and do n't believe the university that it is cheap then old books because they can prey can then you need a new one or they are new feature and you need new versions which you have to pay author t sh uh heard that it it 's not easy to handle at has small keyboard and small screen and uh she think old bo old books are the better choose
970,2,well in this set of materials and the reading passage is about know this um of the stu reaching from traditional text books to electronic text books and the listening passage is a the discussion between students about this no this and this reading passage and said that um the download of the textbook will cost two hundred dollars and it is a one time expense which is mo mo which is more cost effective and of one um and it is also effective because students can highlight or and they 're like um uh on the screen um very and conveniently in the listening passage and the girl uh do not an agree with there 's no this uh she said um one one student j and maybe not use one ever one device uh for the for years and it is not convenient to use because the because of the small screen and the control and the small can childre and
971,2,according to the note is the university will change the traditional text book to in turn lecture books and uh the woman 's opinion there is uh is not a good uh to the decisions because um he think uh first uh it is uh easy to use the tradition a text books because uh it can write write nails and the high like the important sentence and uh can easily find the items uh in addition the uh in lecture uh books uh other the screen is small and uh keypad as way uh it is difficult to use uh to use and uh is not uh beneficial for our study uh all in all his opinion about uh this nails as day would word rather used uh uh traditional text book the and in the lecture book
972,2,personally i agree like that their parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose university uh firstly i think the parents have more social experiences so they know the universities better um secondly i think the parent uh can plan what their children 's to do in the future and uh uh suitable university is very important th th so i think that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university
973,2,i really do not like just thing bad birds because uh for two reason for couple for reasons first they i do n't like the new their ke that 's blown to our and be so he is uh sing a lot of solves uh by this kind of music and uh uh secondly i think he is too young to be a singer hers and as a the age of this time he need to go to the uh school and uh to continue have the educations and to have a good futures not to earn the money from the public
974,2,in this in this conversation the woman do n't think it is a good idea to change the traditional books to some electronic text book cause first uh she think this matters one save a lot of money for students and because we can come th on to use this uh single devise for entire life because it his he did it for them to break down so they have to change one hm also awful of students want to keep up the fashions so with there is n't any new product they some new features that very likely to buy a new one and spend more money and what 's more the woman do n't think it is very convenience to use um this device to help them to study because it it was it was it is too small instead so um it is it 's button and keypad or very hard to be selected so uh the woman think uh this wo n't a lar good as say
975,2,after listening to the late lecture we ca n't see that is a two development that allow the ancient roman cities to expand and there is a ta malls fractures to expand the city there 's a develpment to new construction helps allowed to expand the city and uh the water the acquiring of what they help people because by using the first one with the new construction when there 's a new construction a lot of people as coming out how th they was the people the cities cold we have a new uh population in the new area and they get are upcoming of water to read the upper that helps a lot especially for people one liquid did very far from the leaf uh now they can have a lot of fresh water to used to the wing so that 's a role to call diff city d
976,2,um the professor have the problem with reschedule uh because um she has poetry class and four o'clock and her cousin and has um a bird a on the same time and uh she really want to go to the lecture because uh uh on the next time they will have exam and she want to to review the sage his hm and that will be the good for her students but uh she also does n't want to miss the cause that her cousin 's uh part party hm and um they uh the other professor um was suggesting to uh go to the poetry uh class and then hm she will uh can go to the cousin 's party
977,2,i do n't like the uh group music group uh product ch uh i do n't i do n't know i'm uh i do n't admire their work because i think they 're work is uh they they music is very stressful especially for uh young uh kids and uh hm i think the music has speak influence uh for teenagers and uh this influence is not good for them hm and also i think uh their uh their city discu s uh ha has to be uh pro he pitt it for uh young kids
978,2,i think most important assignment for students to to accomplish is the uh class presentation uh i should this for two reasons the first reason that uh made some student may find a very shy even tall into another people of the other person or making some the presentations of this operas uh opportunity for them to overcome this obstacle uh you know they pity to uh be as nature as they are uh in their daily life is very important for us and the second reason a present it the uh they have uh they have been uh they have to develop their their eighty of independent thinking so this uh this assignment allow them to uh have the ability of independ think which is very important to us nowadays uh because they always did it to per of further or study
979,2,i definitely uh agree with they option of parents be to be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university for the following reasons first they can uh trust they can give uh their experience and they knowledge to the sun um it 's a kind of a adverts um that it will help to choose uh a good university or a good career second uh hm they are very involved in the they in thing the university they are the one that are uh a cut the that give the economic suspend for the time for those two reasons i think parents should be involved in the process of of the university
980,2,so my answer will be check to chan and here are the reasons the first uh or he is films are look look the same uh it will make me borrowing because the always shows is mush or art and finding skills and on the other hand his his films does not show and it uh who main culture that is that he seems only to and also as the the s spe it of fighting and the which is not which not so piece for as we think the the
981,2,the problem is that they try to show classic film but um they ca n't they ca n't shows that film because of their uh because of the film is very old the man the woman suggest suggest suggest to this problem um they they user another classic film and they also suggest that uh they u they bores a film library and uh bo borrow the dvd from library and uh and set up sto uh tv and show the show using the tv i think in the case um it is better for them to show to show the other classic film because uh i think men should n't how what warm looking for choosing uh thing the classic film with big screen and i think tv uh tv set is very small so students uh uh student cannot satisfy ways that show
982,2,uh the shade like to that allow he about the environment of plan environmental friendly uh business are another what is most were most of the uh people are concerning about the environmental uh friendly business and it 's uh very necessary of work conserving energy hm uh and protecting in a natural this environmental friendly business will have uh they the business like that um uh to save their money money and reducing this operating or pretty cost a as an example uh they ge uh what are the lecture uh lecture um said this one coffee shop they live some special kind of li light bulbs for making coffee uh that reduce the electrical energy use uh and another uh another uh kind of a places where it adap a player is napkins and paper they 're used that 's uh recycable uh recycable um paper uh then uh this uh uh we protect the environment and they uh reduce the cost so uh be environmental friendly business will help took reduce the operating cost uh ant protect the environment and save money
983,2,the problem easier woman professor have schedule conflict she has a class which is important to get studen disagree will class at the poetry class before exact nation but she also have the uh every time when party of her housing which will picking love for however the classes which at four so she might be late at the party she has two solution that the man his clea uh colleague not want to help her that uh he can instead review for the students but and she made and she could today cups it but it is from my recommendation i think she should do the review for the student by herself it 's much good for the students to know what exactly is the point of the subject to be has exam then the cause a bus is no matter
984,2,if i would have to talk about uh popular actor who i do n't like his work uh i would have to talk about uh one actor from the trick republic and his name is uh they with a bowl month uh the first reason uh i would say why i do n't admire him it 's because he is known as uh attract a dig th he spend and uh uh because the ness but the le ice the uh for several months and you know he even and then back like three times so that 's the one reason i do n't admire him uh other reason uh is uh that uh he was accused uh from a be
985,2,insects move in ge roots that are called swarms uh they uh work to get a together to accomplish tasks um this behavior uh is called swarm intelligence anyway that the insects uh they all mu uh behave together um old the way uh to accomplish their goal when everyday have an obstacle uh they gather together and help each other um to to reach to the school and uh get solve the problem that is the obstacle that 's on their way uh they know actually do that um liking the ants uh when there is an aware and there are in colonies they help each others uh uh by building a bridge to reach to a food source when they have an up to uh obstacle um and between their call and them
986,2,i think uh the professor 's problem is uh she had to had she had to have a review sections class in tomorrow and it and the same times um her cousin 's retirement party is uh begin to so she ca n't this uh decide uh which uh that uh where she should go and i think she should go to the class because it 's better for for her students because and they should have uh ten uh test uh the week after next week and uh maybe she will miss her cousin 's speech but i think uh her cousin and could uh s and think about hers uh problems and but
987,2,the school plan to change the tradition book uh to electronic electric work and you should buy a device uh about two hundred dollars and to uh use the electric books and the school things you can save money and it also can preview and will build the books easier but the girl did n't agreed with that uh she think it you can save money from that because if you um break uh one device you should buy another one and she also think uh the device screen is too small and uh you can you ca n't use it very if there and you ca n't you even ca n't type uh some words into it and to use it to highlight or sentence is uh so difficult and shape also prefer to use the old fashion uh old fashions materials because is it makes her more confidence
988,2,i believe uh parents should be involved in the process that uh helping their children to choose a university uh first of all they do n't have enough experience to choose so if parents help them and they can uh get uh a lot of knowledge from uh feels and i characters of uh uh university and second reason is that um they can uh they can uh have enough time to choose a university because uh they do they have to i concentrate on their studies so they do n't have enough time to
989,2,it is true that roman heated uh ex them extraordinary uh um uh the rea uh two reason two main reasons for this the swarm is um the added building material you roman used uh to build for example bridges uh across wide real to carry much they you of the river and to make their cities uh exap band uh uh of uh over nor game animal he he can reading wal uh or the way the phone to move fresh water from he think that it is and it is uh actic uh it is uh often what we should bring water clean fresh water from the interested is uh everyone one people one of the club water
990,2,in the conversation the woman professor i have uh the problem that uh help to malls four o'clock uh and afternoon uh she uh she has a class uh for his student her student to review the text and at the same time her cousin have a retirement party and she did n't know which to girl and the the the man professor gave her uh solution uh that uh he can he can help or to cover the class and and and the woman professor uh have another 's solution the uh she could go to the party lazy and in my opinion i would choose the i 'll life in my opinion uh i home the woman professor can go to the uh party makes it that may help her student uh much better
991,2,in my opinion parents should help uh children to choose a university but not the insist a two or specific university the main decision should be by uh the should be the down but children and but uh parents sh uh the should respect that decision cause that they should that are decision should be made only by air interest of children not of uh some reach of parents or or or not the parents um visions on your children patients that 's on the way that uh studying could be successful
992,2,the university plans restriction it 's the two days uh uh thing second call at them where you can and she will be good of the the actions he 's uh and use is his memory good with the it 's as mobile tonight uh right now and and read the things so in the kind of the information and it help but the lady does n't like because is too small it 's uh it 's not it would be to not easy think to use it and uh she likes more the uh their old ways you know is a text book hm although she also thinks that uh every time there is a new one river everyone 's one once the new one and so
993,2,as a woman face uh scheduling complex uh she wants to ge but she wants to go her cousin 's retirement party uh on four pm too more uh but he face a problem is that she has a review section for his class on the same time so the woman has a two possible solutions for the situation first uh she can let the other teacher cover her class second she can not uh good to the party personally i recommend that she that uh the other teachers who carry her class because if it do this the students ki and uh get ready for the test and she can uh enjoy or herself in the high in her cousin 's retirement party to
994,2,the woman 's problem is that her several a schedule became complex complex the man in the woman discuss two possible solutions the first solution is that um the man english teacher help her students review test to schedule the second solution is that um i think the first solution is better than the second one that 's because uh she uh her family in tire party is interesting in important and uh for these reasons i prefer to the sick the for two solution
995,2,um as a uh swarm intelligence the reflects with a group activity of in insects um um so um uh so uh it 's um it can be applied on uh ants uh on and activity um um um sense uh the uh the sense that the individual ant will be it will not be able to um solve problems in the and it can case uh the group of ants uh sub uh illustrated uh illustrate the concept of swarm intelligence um the example is stated in an actor and uh was um um um distracted illustrate that perfectly uh the concept of and group activity by their i am in a stating that is that the mechanism of uh hm obtaining food uh my making something that like camp bridge between times just
996,2,i really hate the in addition many of in addition singers and actors uh is really uh that are top you learner because uh they uh re are often appears in the television but they are clearly that but they are quality in a performing it 's really uh low for example uh one of the male singers is one of the female singers like uh the group man of the like uh the sister or whatever is that uh the uh they usually appears on some kind of uh s a lot elevations they they are really good in uh acting that they are really lect in singer i really hate that kinds of uh actress
997,2,the new plan is their school list trying to switching task through to lend divide the school said it only cost two on read other pu the device and then after you buy the new can download for mate to con for the contest uh the woman he think that she is not a bring to the idea is about the school because it 's not really the course they cause uh a lot because more than the textbook because if it breaks or you pre comes out with more but she new feature that student have to pay it and also is the screen is small uh it it 's not each to select to function because it 's small keypad it has small keypad to
998,2,um a popular actor that i do not of um admire ants hm uh um some kind of actor who always to see him well uh because those kind of actors uh always show same characters so uh it 's not that uh in uh passing he whenever i saw the movie or mar that she or she appo uh because it 's the kind of boring because it 's too typical their acting is to typical so uh i do n't do not might i admire techn of actors d
999,2,i did a project in a class about debts situation wise to raises some in america i learned a lot of times but particularly learnt importance of understanding every each other and in taller and because otherwise it 's gonna combined can her me all of the not only the person who is being discriminated but also the personal is being goods desk mainly eating for example d d re
1000,2,the university is kind to sh switch down uh method there teaching they 're going to use now electronic devices and they 're going to give up for the books so uh the all the students shou by the device and this is going to be but only one time any the class is two hundred dollars the woman is not uh is not that it 's not has he has her opinion she done think his going to be only one device because if it is going to break or it is going to have new features that device is very hard to do s difficult to use and it is very small so it 's difficult to someone eyes or to underline all the stuff and uh she thinks she like the old way of teaching taking notes and have
1001,2,due due to considering i'm i'm very aggressive and on like book person i do not like sh uh work he performs um firstly it 's always it 's saves very success it seems very much uh again s women it 's usually seems uh also uh uh a little bit um reese 's uh which is for me uh bigger early bigger sleep that if you uh consequently i do not j admire hm his work has a rapper and as a musician as most people will
1002,2,actually i did n't i do n't admire mozart the music and and him the first reason the why i chose him is uh his music is very uh o difficult understand for novel perfor um normal person the fo i can enjoy uh his music for long time uh more over uh his music is uh so the important for the novel t and uh it is related to the uh not related with their uh normal persons life therefore i do not admire him and his music
1003,2,enter and then i do not admire is traditional um there were two reasons firstly uh his not patients and he 's uh in so it 's not patients uh in his concert is not uh is not good to to his fan thing and also uh she some bad bores to his fans and i thinks not very good and secondly i think i think may he 's so hm he 's the roots and uh uh and is a rude in always sings uh some bad things bet bores to somebody who around him
1004,2,the professor has a problem uh she has two is schedule calls like one is that at four o'clock she has a class that she needs to review for a task and the other one is that her cousin is retire so the professor his friend suggest her that she could to busy to for her and she could go there um go to do time par party and she also said that she could go later to the party uh that she have is going to miss on in my opinion she should go uh give class to the kid to the people there to the students because that 's her drop and they needed they need her to give other reviews because the other is visited is not familiar with the ten and she go later to the party because she can also view out the speeches and everything to video he sing picture then she could have an id about the party into stu enjoy he
1005,2,in the lecture the professor describes two ways make ca n't get disappear hm the first way is actually a lecture process in which the late maybe she would in ways now uh organic settlements of glance or others and in there are less with room for water in them that make and it happens you early when there is a lot of plants in the um night the second process like it is by the hm f human activity and it can be seeing in the case of now a favors they will usually prop water to every date their crops but without re fill the water by rain or stream the make can get strive because no their activity of the farmer so that 's the two ways that can uh result in that is appearance of the like that is describe by the professor in this lecture d
1006,2,the event jus a thing that i i like to s stay in a uh hm in the place with no people a few people roaming i think because at first gi uh and uh and i can concert it is so in this crowd plays i can cousin 's concentrate or my attention to my study so i i will not get destruction by others and then uh second i can do what i want like a practice my english a to seek a lot and then the boy they have a cannot another distract others i think it is very import i like this way i have an uh ni if his in the most efficient way to study in him as me thank you
1007,2,there are two solution to process hm team which the elect would disappear the first process is through not purposes that like some plants my grow um hm on the other button of a lake and uh as a plant growth and advice uh the mole and more uh their body of leaf plants uh will be and the put it on the part another they ca which will eventually filled feels uh the lake act so so that um so the lect will disappear totally and another uh protects is his through who you my activity that is maybe human will comes the water out of the lake to imitate their crops and if there is no or river run in roaming inte with the the lake then the lake will be eventually that out then then elec will were even very event with their out so they are this to process of how lake will doubt
1008,2,uh the plastic it to the send text so apart text books uh uh the leaves that uh uh to uh to using it it will get students and uh this uh like they as uh uh is environmental so the woman uh does n't feel that uh this is going to help the uh the reasons being first uh she feels that the courses with an their stick fist if he 's a expected to and uh she put that uh keep our water but it for these on takes only for a things modest it in small car uh is a bird latest uh feet his so this means that things from caused requ i and also uh the main uh deals with more people small it and uh cons time so it is like a leading and learning uh be difficult the in a and practice books uh that than i thin not to some textbooks
1009,2,i agree uh with parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university for three main reason the first reason is that they have choose before th most of the times and they have the previous experience uh to show them the f past to follow the second reason is that they know perfectly their children and what are they uh uh experiences and the few to a for su meant and and the third reason as is that they know uh better a physically the most of the universities because they have a have no more information from uh new send from other uh resources
1010,2,the university is planning to replace uh the the libraries from traditional started to electric style but actually the woman disagrees with the this plan because of three reasons first three uh she 's very worried about if it 's broken and secondly it is it is too small to use in the classroom and finally fashion prefers old fashion style but actually i agree with the idea because it is more convenient for students especially studying distant learning because they can reach their diversities from new or they they been so i agree with the s placement as as
1011,2,the roman expense sense of cities in the lecture are mainly due to to uh uh specific uh tec take et improve made buys the romans so first one is the concrete country it 's uh makes the romans about to wait uh better bridges and those uh better bridges makes the romans about to move more or material across the river so it was uh easier to expand the city the although discoveries was uh aqueducts aqueducts uh those uh aqueducts mate make as uh water available uh far war uh to people so people can uh built high lose uh for in the cities so it was easy more easy for them to will
1012,2,i think the parents should be invol in the process of helping their children to choose a university wide have two reasons the first it 's that your your of parents always have more expensive exp experiences that new and that is helpful to take a decisions the second reasons uh i think that your parents love him and i want the best for you finally they film reason is because they have they can think other things that you did n't think
1013,2,the female professor has a conflict of two models review classes and uh i also her cousin 's retirement party so is worried about like which one to choose so uh the male professor advised her to give had some uh uh prepare materials so he can uh review uh he can go and review the all the b uh poetry listen should her students but the second option was that female taught of that uh if she could uh review the situation of students and arrive late at uh her cousin 's uh retirement party than that would be good but uh the only thing is that uh if she come late at the retirement party and she might uh uh miss all the interesting speech given by uh cousin and if the uh that will be ashamed to her so follow the uh i would suggest that the woman should uh review uh go for the review session
1014,2,the woman 's problem is that uh she is having a scheduling conflict uh hm she asked uh uh she needs to help the students review for the poetry class but at the same time she has the cousin 's retirement party um and there are two suggestions mention in the listening the first one is to um go to retirement party and the manner hope or with the review section the second uh suggestion is that uh the woman herself goes to the uh review section and or go to the party they i prefer the first suggestion because um on the woman is getting pay for the job and the text is very important for students if uh the students uh do not to ro in their test uh they might uh playing the woman uh and the woman uh so for these reasons i prefer the first choice
1015,2,the university release the new plan that they will they will change to traditional textbook to electri in the electronic textbook prof next year and students have time device for two hundred down years but is not only one time but female dislike the university 's plan because first given the devices only two hundred dollars and easily is movie shape than books if it is broken or new new products will come out students to replace boring and it cost a lot second it 's not is to use because keypad core screens are so small third she prefers old fashioned way to study for these reasons the female students do n't like the university 's new pla
1016,2,in my opinion parents be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university because of the following two reasons first of all he have experience to choose their the university in the or or high school student and the second of all they they know which is schools or good for their children because they know their children for no to choose the university so so the parents should be help them to to s how university the
1017,2,i will talk about uh mission band who which is um bowl the talking although and um i personally do n't like this band because uh they do the music uh for commercial reasons and uh uh not for musicians reasons what the su but i think but um they do n't have any talents and uh they only does that to um moneys and uh and not to to straight their own uh music musician ways to express uh the talents and think uh i do n't like this band because of that and uh
1018,2,opinion cannot talk about one fame is uh musician of my country her name a sha occur all the reason that uh i do n't like her i do n't admire her it 's because um first so i do n't like to needs a she 's doing now i do n't like that uh the reason why uh it 's that she thing in well uh another reason uh that i do n't like her is cause because uh as she changed to with the when they have uh that she was thinking before now she is thinking in something totally different
1019,2,someone con is n't popular actor an indian when they 're still use work i do n't admire for following reasons the reason one he really does n't mainte of he act at times rarely overact you can and make out when a seed acting that is over there he does n't and then make their conditions in a natural how environment but i and but he tries to overact and another reason the is that his i could ants uh uh act is ability and being acting in the in a good act as is did n't wanted over abilities like acting singing and nothing so he 's was not a good arts and now he is a good he 'll lacks fault of the phone two reasons i i really do n't admire uh his act
1020,2,the top in of this lecture was that uh when many insects uh became a swarm intelligence uh they cannot accomplish the text they can uh tech and be achieved bike one insect uh the professor in the lesser there 's the example of ants and when the ants has time the branch and the from in the branch uh they they good up to the branch uh uh if the food is uh next is at the next branch uh they make a they make the bridge and they will uh they make a bridge and then get a food and they make a bridge uh they will go whether while and to go to operate and appo duties and the other cou offer good to it uh weather one they make a bridge so they can go to the next which and good for them
1021,2,the unive topic here is about is concept of swarm um the professor gives a good example have a this concept the swarm concept applies in the reading passage the professors state that uh i mean in the reading passa said them they some insect them live live in a large groups or swarms um that allows them to accomplish complex tasks in the professor gives an example of this he said that ants when they want to read some food on the tree um in days a branch they s a space it in branches what they do is uh is one ants go first and stretched
1022,2,this professor has a gave lecture or i review lecture because her students uh will take the exam next week at the same time hm her cousin retirement party would help so she is not true read dirt where she is not your how th can she do it how can she do how can she go to the class and at the same time how can she uh go to the cousin retirement party and how there is one of the best reason that i think it is the best uh that uh she can let the other professor do uh there are uh the review class for her and she uh give him she can give them uh she can give them the uh notes and uh uh that the preparation papers i think this one is it will be better because i think she will have enough time to stay with her cousin and she will not be expo uh she will not be um uh
1023,2,the university as planning to uh is planning to turns uh it is planning to uh create new a new way of teaching cell uh she will uh leave the traditional bound text book and uh th uh at sh uh and she will move to use and she will use the electronic books or the electronic ones and the so students will be able to download the books uh the electronic uh box uh any how uh it will co like a cost uh it uh if this uh it to student two thousand uh two hundred two hundred uh dollars uh the this students she does n't like the idea um she does n't like it at all that first of all because of the cost it will cost two hundred and is she thinks it 's too much the other thing is the device is that my it my it may bright might be broken at any time and uh the the it uh the other think it is very small and uh even the new version if they create new version they will
1024,2,all the actors in the in the talk about its proper damaging near whole known as the other man then uh international cinema seen i believe that is where it is not really great and i 've go sensible reasons are the so i think uh he was speaks with the time the voice of the kind of decorating to other people i do not think that his acting uh can place the message of real actors has our believe the his work really uh be reflects how an actor perform the past uh i think that actors first of all need to be in morally prove the more really uh approve the people and uh if they not other on believe they can be could grow mother also get a children
1025,2,the woman has a schedule conflict at uh tomorrow uh she 's got uh poetry poetry class at four o'clock and her cousin 's retire party at the same time but i think she should go to the class rather than cousin 's party and during the party later after the class because uh she can always join the party later about if she miss the class students will on not be able to get the exact information on what the test is going to be like and it will influence the text course greatly that 's not rick reminder room so uh i think she should grow to uh class well
1026,2,so it it is planning to uh adapt to new system to improve the quality of studying uh invi friendly call to for studying to the students and uh and so by providing then electronic device which they could a p load does um they 're studying materials and so which will replace the text books and hand books like guidelines and and so which and the woman do n't like that idea so she thinks that if some if you dis breaks or and it 's not user friendly it 's small size and uh if there be uh there is not these their people would like to d and also she she likes the old fashion and to summarize and highlight things and paper based
1027,2,the university will switch from the traditional bound book electrical books but can aims and that devices but uh the woman does n't agree with the uh did n't agree and she does n't like it because first the cost because if every every student will not use uh this device for the for years over the whole semester because it may break or some some student like to have the better version of the new device and and she had that uh device is very small and the keypad and control is very small so it 's very hard to highlighted the not is not and she thinks that the old way with the traditional books is more easier comfortable for her and she she does n't agree with this practiced
1028,2,nancy has t then it 's he is just p plant another exp pace uh tend to whether the little um explodes uh s s can buy from by the cost of two hundred dollars and gives them you all the time far pri sh another ex and then she classes party uh in the in the second um do n't why this in the uh because try she has prof or dead rob with advisors he do n't rude not and rather and she also like study comments no like reading book hen it was about stud about my opinion i also agree or other i would like to stand room in order to to come want or well by roman books and highlighting the important to our in not lecture import
1029,2,the musician the rese i personally do n't like learnt japanese missions and because they are to they do not convey their life appropriate language and they do n't have uh i think they come put in my as much is very in their music for example have must he i mean who is a famous th with uh sing uh ju uh ch she sings i think pre web out the not can they any message into her music and her music is sometimes too noisy and to find then uh i do n't appreciate them
1030,2,swarm intelligence is really really to complete complex tax that individual members cannot do for example ants move in a large group called swarm the ants groups and or ants swarm construct bridge with their bodies when the for that 's say there is a distance open space between some branches and grant branch and plant plants and a branch in the which are ant cannot bridge from one branch to another but has has a group they can form bridge between the branches and the the rest so that the rest of the group can cross the bridge to cross the bridge this examplifies a swarm intelligence which into which are ants cannot do
1031,2,the pro the period of this so was having a schedule conflict ch whereby her she deal of the class with the students call light with a plan to attend her cousin 's retirement party and that conflict as she was she was like she was like step to come and their from which want to do so she explain the problem to the professor which is suggested a solution that he would defined of uh of covering the class for her which she appreciated their phone but still prefer to cover the class herself and letter attend the party which is a second option and i was a this the second option because the students will get tired ri j
1032,2,i agree with the statement i i believe the parents should help their children in choosing call is pop first reason is they are not children are not art enough to make a good disease when to using police also ease one of the biggest point in your life so they you 're most be care for choosing call is i think parents can help their children to guide to the light if the action because they had better long leaves and experience if
1033,2,one of the uh most important reasons behind the expansion of uh roman cities is that there are uh this uh invention of advanced building materials uh for it by and that material is called concrete by using the concrete they build uh new buildings and um bridges bridges so bridge is the one of the most important uh bridge sur ins please uh important rude uh to expand their uh cities because because of the bridge uh people can uh go across the rivers and expand their higher civilization another important a reason of um um behind the expansion of roman cities is that uh improve the movement of for flow improvement of peo fresh water they build aqueducts true beach and they can uh they can is uh supply water to all the uh too long um uh over long distances and people can have access this pure water so they can built uh
1034,2,in the announcement the university will change that hm the now te text book to the electronical time if electronic text book for the following reasons first first reason is that uh text process getting hire and not only device will charge once then you can use the text book for a long time so it will be more economical and next reason is that uh by the device we can use it using very useful way like highlighting some sentence well like uh saving or main or something but the woman woman do n't uh he do n't like that ca that plant because if the device is break down or operate it then each we should buy new one next one uh next uh the the device screens very small important is small to it is hard to control the device is very hard
1035,2,nancy a professor has a conflict she has a poetry um class at four o'clock and she also has cousin 's retirement party at four o'clock because she does n't want to miss any of those she has a conflict and so the other ke professor come up with the idea that he could cover the poetry class for nancy but then land this idea is nancy covers the poetry section for her students and arrive at the party late and i think named this ideas more important it is better than the other professor 's idea because um because nancy uh can could can to both of her schedules show feel better because uh the professor did n't cover the work for her and also because um the other professor did n't teach poetry for a long he could n't he could give out that the class for the students
1036,2,i do n't like the person it 's name the height uh it 's or just uh uh artist in china and uh he always to uh uh play some a better movie and i do n't like this kind of movie so i do n't like this person uh uh your really he e mail you know uh take uh ru in the movie it 's just like some bad by often someth on bet better person have some uh best all to them the peoples them ver so society and i uh i think it 's a just them uh better rule for other people in the mind it 's it 's a bad person uh in the mean time um maybe it 's just the also the me uh my of the director
1037,2,two developments that about on signed roman cities to expands are the reading materials and uh aqueducts the building materials lead romans uh their better uh bridges uh create uh or necessary facilities an infrastructure to move food uh transport uh people uh also build aqueducts these are necessary to uh provide water to the city so they the romans were able to um to transport water food and provide old necessary he elements to have uh uh normal life well with old necessary elements to to have a very productive society
1038,2,the woman does not mike the new plan of university and a hope she made some points uh the to this uh the cost is not very stick um in time uh he doe he in time during their university you wo n't stick the uh one device the meeting sh they devise good into their know new versions as to read i think it uh the size of the device is too small uh that you one import higher right or underlying uh in the text end so sh she like to stick with the old fashions um efficient way of learning sticks books and uh because she could n't write notes and also have ice and then i so
1039,2,well the woman 's problem site she 's got this poetry class the starts at four and she was preparing for their uh her students review session right but she does relies her cousin 's retirement start at four as well the man and woman discuss two pos solutions first solution they discusses the man could cover have class second solution they discusses and all she could do the review were solve and arrive the retirement made in my opinion first solution is better than the second one one reason is that um if man is a professor break english professor as well grades so in though he has n't taught poetry for years and push it will be okay with the review materials sorry and push it will fresh of his memory and he would be good at teachings second reason is that um if she teaches really verse of that mean she 's going arrive at the retired way right and that way she will be missing speeches buyer cousin the would be really interesting and would be a shame to miss those speaks species species
1040,2,swarms intelligence is the act we abi a group of animals move together to perform it tells that uh and in dv d uh animal cannot do uh an example of this is shown in the talk by the lecturer when invention ants as an example of the swarm intelligence animal which most together to get their food i gives an example in a case we 're art buys a branch where there 's food but if the bri she 's a little bit far away from this ants the ants we connect it short that one by one look uh moving towards we are this food is and by being these together collecting issue down moving clothes uh they get the food and take the food and apart from this they move and block so that it can be easier for them to perform any tasks that individual cannot do
1041,2,in the passage the were read about the university placing textbook to if a new computer version uh which will to put late and but then the student have some problems about it first of all it had cost it 's course about two hundred dollars not every student has a money they get it also they uh because it is a device it can be brave broke or may be wants a new updates for their that would cost on also the device is and the lead of easy ensure that uh uh be less expensive and buying book of look because so eyes uh it might be hard to use for people with long large finger or it 's not so use them conclusion in conclusion the student like to the old fashion way of studying books private can skype and she is kind skeptic about weather and she would like change to electronic device
1042,2,i think should parents should be involve process of helping children to choose the university because the first reason is that is because parents uh has a great uh background they has the life uh over their show others so they knew more they can suggest something good and parents uh there are no re a letter suggest something bad bad for their children and they knew more about what what will be helpful for their children what 's non they do n't i think they do n't need to say them or what to do hm but they need to uh show them the way which is better for their children to choose
1043,2,i strongly agree that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university because parents or more experience than their children and they know better about this world so they can advice what university will be great for the children 's future in this world for example we even my parent for helping me deciding university cause these two le i'm planning to our university and their opinions and advises helping need graded greatly to choose my university to prepare my future in thank you
1044,2,lady is that i is the new new nation night i do n't rev li like with it because i i do n't like her her nor uh loud and uh uh i do n't i do n't know wide so many people like like her wr letter lady got them may near yeah in there i think that uh her music him a late of more wisely uh uh i do n't think her clothing is very uh very cool very potter it 's it 's it 's fracture little s th ranch s uh i do n't really like her uh sent sp
1045,2,university is switching transition from i like from the not traditional book more pretty electronic more it cause a round dollar two hundred it 's very simple to operate and i did does and it easy to note taking this this so this way university has article the teacher but according to the needing who comes in picture she says like she 's more comfortable with the traditional handing of which is very easy you can understand uh that 's uh she can quarter and a quiet on important up rather than going for the at the base which is one then ask because it 's not has you cost costs wanting which is not has realistic buying for and uh they do this such i have to buy want to just get de greater just like one of the letter sh racial cannot be updated and moreover the keypad and control pair whatever think is not that easy to handle the features she mentions like eighteen to twenty send with at all that ants system is all about it 's not easy to use all the feature
1046,2,opinion professor thought uh is teaching a poetry class at four o'clock and tomorrow she have a review session for her student but at the same time she have a retirement party of her cousin uh so she she 's not she 's uh she 's confuse tw it uh she 's confuse about the appointment of the retirement party the other professor uh give help the option to cover her class uh uh and he will taught uh student the party the other j uh uh solution that he offer head is to uh is to is and the other solution that she have to is to do the review session and to go late for the party i think that she could take the a part of the professor and he could cover the class for her uh by using the in the material she already prepared so she wo she will not be uh should n't be late for them a retirement party because her cousin and other relatives is giving a speech and she it 's so shame to for her to miss the speech so i prefer this uh uh
1047,2,d uh one of the professor uh have pro like uh he have a class f of where it to at four o'clock at the think time uh he have another uh retirement party of the offer cousin working recommend there is this is uh f he might to uh give the class to another professor so he might be or could buying this class d he can attend the retirement party so she may get the interesting about uh are related does he have enough time to enjoy and uh it just the review session for that the professors can eyes these d
1048,2,i agree and uh the sense that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university this because first of all the parents have the notes about which s filled the children should go for example might bought there is working for korean international cooperation urgency so he he is the one the who have at of knowledge about the working working felt hm in bowls korean and other other countries as well so when i was i was trying to pick the major major in business field she he kind of give a lots of idea about the treating company and also you can see another international company as well
1049,2,the university plan school bring electronic books in the base of traditional books from the electronic book student spend download the contain uh easy this call store two hundred it is a one time expense says the many from their textbooks expensive textbooks and the woman does not like this plan because she thinks that if the electronic book is broken we have to get a new one and also in there are latest was n't the student will like to have a good one and that when he spend it is very easy to use though they does roots but on the electronic books so why we use the hard books and she likes the did is looks a sea like underlying i like the books it
1050,2,the campus and the con the conversation uh that there are going to ch switch all their and i will books in to the you 'd lecture device eys textbook which will cost wonder point about hours bridge it what and it 's an initial cost they claim that is going to save students what a computer the rising textboo prices and s treasure um features the built in the device is going to help students studying however the woman is dis disagree with the idea of the school but because it 's a source to realistic and people got it 's not gonna which should because it it will and to break and you people will be good to buy new one and it let does n't cause more money also the new features not going to be co easy to use because that device is too small and the keypad is old too small so she likes old fashion way
1051,2,one musician that i do n't like is metallica or let 's say a group um even though metallica is a really famous uh group for band because of the the the amount of years that has been on they in they uh in the music environment even though that i i do n't like it because uh their music is way to heavy it 's too loudy uh i believe it 's how um is a type of music that some people enjoy but is not necessary my type definitely this is a friends are desire that i do n't i do n't enjoy because of the type of music that that play that they play
1052,2,i do agree in part uh dutch parents uh parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose uh university becau they 're more experience with uh university their uh ge they have better choice ten uh than children because sometimes children choose and uh university because of the friend most of the uh the friend goal uh go there so sometime is not because uh the universities cute but because they get frien over there so i think uh the parents should be involved in this process professor
1053,2,the profession professor has a schedule problem she has to be a just call with uh uh review session with her students at four o'clock and also she has to be uh th uh retirement party uh she wants to be in the to places um one of the solution is that uh there are there the other professor can uh be uh in the class instead of her and he has the le experience but he has a lot a lot of time know that uh thus and uh give uh poetry uh class but uh the other uh i suggest that um is ci can be invol place is because she each usage is that she can make the review session and after that go to there be time party i think is very important for her to be with their students because she just if her and after that she can go the party
1054,2,parents university for their children is better that students to s for their own firs a foremost parents can choose university by families money for example performance cannot uh choose university which has to pay too much money some student maybe not made be do not know this secondly uh parents uh they know the in more information about uh university and they can to the best uh university which have has teacher and uh good study wearing for their children uh finally parents always uh care about the current student feel feel water and they will choose the best for their to do so parents tools university by the d
1055,2,university 's plan is to uh change the old uh textbooks into hm a system where it can be uh electronic uh access to the students in order to study um which costs about two hundred dollars um her opinion is that uh it should be that way because um it it can be really hard to use and uh they will always be uh updates on the on the um on a device and this can create some more expenses because there would be people that will want to update their devices as well another issue that she p when i was for people that had um due to the fact that the the device is small there are people that i have a hard time using uh small screens and small key pass
1056,2,well in my opinion i would definitely agree with the point that parents should be participate in the process of helping their children to s who 's uh university diverse are two reason one is that uh the parents are experience in the social life for his band for for instance uh or parent are very very experience your social life oh he know they know everything about way do know second thing is that the parents advice always reliable because they are doing warming decision for their children so they were advisor relied also for those reason i think the parents should involve in helping children choose
1057,2,as the passage elaborates the caught of small swarm intelligence is a group of a colony of small insects coming together at accomplishing a task that would be impossible for any single members to do on it 's all in the lecture the professor gives a specific example of this using ants as an example he uh explains that ants move together to a food source uh and when they encounter obstacles on the way they work together to uh to get pass that obstacle she he gives a particular example of trees they of uh ants walking on a tree and they need to uh walk poor and walk to the and of a branch but need to move to another branch which is not connected so there is a gap in between he explains that the uh the ants form a chain by holding old to each other uh and therefore uh by doing this task they allow the other ants to walk over them uh and this an example of swarm intelligence pu
1058,2,in the reading material the school newspaper just side at where um students want to music building uh opened bran a night pm too midnight to their be are two reason f reason first one as uh besides the music uh practice permit musing building there is no get place the practice the second the students is hard to students raise the practiced ran so if the time of sha uh so at the music of um building should be open uh tell me night in the listening listening material the woman has a brave that there 's now th first reason is that she is a great that the years now get place the besides the uh music building practice ran and this and she has a s the second reason is that she cannot played instrument in dormitory bec was about the ste term the students they around re around hers studying more sleeping and second uh the third reason is that be your a lot of the big concert things good for examples brain a concert and winter concer uh musicians need a place
1059,2,well the professor learns that that they are j to to wait elect the ca n't its period and the first is the late fro ways that so the hm uh organic um a disagree or the and uh some uh plant that i out e and the down third temp the and the fill in the lakes the and uh eat them um uh it dead that water in the lake and this period and the second he did human activity bad that make the disagree with that i uh the uh wo acumen hm used water is they are and the into rap to their parent up the lake and hm pur rude to do the lake the and um uh the for uh there are two kind of form hind of will waste that i make the latest disappear it or not so my um on sugge the questions
1060,2,the woman think this is a the proper it 's like good and the problem the pro the proper is that hm their room should be um uh should be open to entered with my j and the first you read he she gives is that um um refer s and the sea they can go to the real um and it and the time is they and and and and what have n't they have times and it better to for their study another as has suggestion is a lot reason is that um they can uh it 's not know the um it it out it rock to firstly they and understand it 's students and the and not really is that there 's an uh um not not rude other are used to for practice parties get use the ke uh such as as breaks counselors and uh some conc eq concert this concert as i for rock fall people
1061,2,the example of the television advertising for parts and path it 's a really good example for the technique of uh refuse enter strip um inc te uh this example shows the woman who is a cook um who uh who use these techni in fact she begin the at the advertisement uh by a same but uh part a pad uh is an expect is an expands save um company um and there are so many others company but at least uh she says that it worth it because they uh save your your money in um in the long run so um uh uh first she she it has uh she tells uh that it 's uh it 's a bad it 's bad think that it 's expensive but in fact she says that it 's worth it 's okay his could
1062,2,in this listening material the um woman has a problem that is in their will cannot be finish an time so the man gives her two suggestions one is to interview there at the director later on the next to it and the one the other one it 's the interview and the the actor instead of to into the give uh the actor um as far as i'm concern i think second one is better first because hm to interview during uh actor can know the the the other aspect of the whole movies that not cannot get from the actor another one is actor is uh reading participate in the movie so if you if you interact interview uh in a rude was we have uh they will more think this be fit specific details of them is that
1063,2,the students are discussing about a problem that uh the man has about the article newspaper because he was suppose to interview that direct the director of the play but the director is sick and cannot have uh make the interview so he can wait till he feels better but um will be not on time for week newspaper and the play start this weekend and the other solution is to interview one actor which i think it 's the best solution because even it 's not the director it 's an actor their actor knows everything about a play uh how it 's made the costumes and what is it about ants of the the article will be brad it before the play begins so people
1064,2,the passage explain explains add to make used uh for advertisement which is called which it and persuade it says that when there is a about issue about the product the company that sells that pro uh can do this kind of advertise of the advertisement which is saying something the bad things but point about that product but then sing something really positive that that 's that makes that that point uh not such part point and in the lecture they they mention important hands advertisement walk company they say that um the first uh the woman in the advertisement says the bad point of that product which is the cost and then they they talk about the extra other than lecture cost is worth it because they last longer and they have a really good uh were n't e so that 's that 's an example of the the few do n't project
1065,2,the man 's problem is he want to interview the director of the school ply uh in this week but he has start uh pad cold so she could so so he could n't interview him uh one of the suggestion is he could interviewing when he when the director feel better but the passage you will be will be put in the lect the weeks newspaper uh and another option is he uh he could interview the actor one back to the day but the actor uh do n't know everything about the scoop like and uh if i were the man i will choose to to interview the director in the next week after he has uh he has that better because uh we want my everything about the school by and the director knows better than the actor about the scoop light but the time is and necessary for the interview i think
1066,2,company path and ants um demonstrate two they 're they are various about him like they are um their better solve these for uh for customers uh first person science products uh we seeing more expensive than other products to to their customers but um the company demonstrated uh special i time a water gets uh which which can can their products uh and more more died over and cost effective eventually so by showing the kind of it
1067,2,i do n't think advertisement what can be and talk food uh should not be show on tv because uh does not does not does n't have does n't have uh to protect them their children from um buying buying a kind of talk food uh more important think is uh that the parents the parents should protect and and i more her through more happy food for their show young children
1068,2,uh lakes kid appear in two different ways as the professor to sold in the lecture the first uh the first way is it can this appear in a natural way and in the second and the second way is that uh i like him is appear in uh human uh packed the national way it 's because sometimes uh the wakes uh get some organic seme to so the man to it and it starts to to fill the bottom of the uh the lake so when some times so in uh so in some time uh the week will be all filled with trees in organic uh settlements the second way to a lake gets can disappear is by human acts when a farmer for example uh gets uh the water from the rea from like it can get stru i in some s i'm if it 's not free field
1069,2,i think that the group projects for the students are most beneficial uh because some there are not able to complete by by self and i think group they can make the projects more comprehensive and be and also uh by group working they can perfect themselves file looking ant others doing things uh like uh advance i had right uh they uh creative writing and i and my partner discussed oh over it so uh over projects is better than that i
1070,2,the man use very f rated and worried because he is in charge in a school play and he has to interview with his uh professor uh however the professor got a bad cold so she cannot acted uh the man can either wait until the professor recover and or he can uh interviewed a need actor in state if i were the man i think i would technically uh interviewed lead actor in state over woman read actor prop way does not have uh so much say about he way um but um uh i can hand hen out uh the play continents on time so i think that is more uh that it 's better to whether than uh to audience ins and uh the actors and um me especially so i think i will will interview i would in the really actors
1071,2,well the the me the school uh learn out uh a propo stand uh practice room o when not open until the le the might pm it 's not good because there is no place for through chilly enough students to pre practice their instruments and the they too too large number of students who who wants to play them so though the the the the girl the girl uh agree with this propose because uh they can pra practice the instruments in the dorm and uh they can they they can use them more times and uh can do this for um whatever they when whenever they are and uh and they can do a lack of uh benefit to they are aerial expressions in in in some some semester
1072,2,well uh the lakes wor work or and permit at big they can disappear or some times the the first way the the wait they can disappear because of the major major regions they feel because they are such as ex a for example there there plants di di from uh around the that the lake and they they they thought in to the the uh the the lay ca n't new plans fault again if you 'd about um the build up to the bought and of the lay can fill up so they are their last their last plants who water to filling so there are eventually spear that the second is the that human activities her because former in repeated upon the water out of the like to fill the the that the forms that but the re feel of string rain that they did n't replace eventually so there are eventually
1073,2,uh the problem is is the um bike want to uh into be about the school why i and and he schedule the ch or for the interview but uh today uh structure has a pu bad cold so uh to directly can not uh join the interview so there is two option to solve this problem that uh uh option one is uh wait until next week to um uh to director can feel better from the uh bad cold but uh it is kind uh sense of late because or the play will or will start before the article has publish it and so i think the inter build the lead lecturer uh is more better option because lead lecture has uh enough information of the pla i i think
1074,2,yeah i do things added has meant for can be engines food is not be shown on tv uh two reasons the first and that the uh the attachment will leave his guide the children 's attention mitch with a for the advertisement hm by some it can listen chang to so it 's not write the second reason that three of to buy some very mary important any benefit of time for the the in the children because they cannot enough time and not sing form television prop s program example some and cut home some some document but if he if he she had a times of can day is it 's maybe know it 's it is a waste of time and then that 's all i think why i should uh we should uh um delay to the the other has meant for can be an exact food should not be shown on to acquire
1075,2,briefly the proposal stating that the new building should open more time for the students musicians and students who want to re univers his that until midnight and uh found uh opinion of this woman always girl uh she is quite happy and definitely agree with this proposal because uh with this proposal uh there are two ben benefits that first uh if we have these classroom to play want and disturb or influence other students uh so uh and the second reason is that hm they should uh they can get a lot of tiny to pract tech some selves is a special peoples because some concert with a start and it 's quite helpful for the relation student so why that 's are the two reasons she thinks it 's good d
1076,2,the professor gives an example of a reduce impor shade technique in advertisement by describing one of he has from the commercial that he has song yes seen in this convertion a profession uh uh other media that uh these pass and pan from this specific company is expensive more expense than other product so so maybe the buyers a want do n't want to buy uh the prof the profession also said that in the roman it will save your money cause the company offers like time war in team uh in this example the part weird uh profession a said is expensive it 's a review technique enter in the final she said the right time worry he mention about went is uh example of pur shade so it be a good example for showing a appo shade uh no reviewed in project
1077,2,i believe uh personally believe that uh advertisement for can be and job food should be should not be on the told fishes for the reasons first can the advertisement for can be in job food can cause children to walk more john studen candies uh is really bad for their help and also if day sees adver advertisement uh for can the injure food and they will keep asking for it to their parent so their parents have the parents can co uh advertisement for can be engine for it can cause parents economically burden
1078,2,the man had a problem about a finishing his article the newspaper because of that the director of the director he had to into real had get uh old so uh he might have some problem about it and there is some solutions he can choose one is that he can still into will that uh direct about on not on these days so he might be de later time to the made articles and what 's more is that he can change another wanted in into real he can into real their actors ins instead of the director but the actor might not have so much to say so i think it 's really a good idea to interview other uh actor because uh only on this way he want have to delay he is uh paper to the newspaper um but what 's more is that maybe the actor will know as much as the direct no and the actor has a lot of it 's parent to experience of uh of the of when he want to now
1079,2,uh the proposal concerns the practi practice from in the university it 's a room which is uh male uh for student to play the own instrument so it 's asked the university if maybe this room could be uh open letter in the evening uh to uh time made student to practices later and to permit mo student to practice so the girl uh it 's totally agreed with the statement because she uh often has to uh repeat in uh room but she does n't like it because uh it 's we noisy and it can uh another way a lot of people in the other rooms near his her home own room and uh also she
1080,2,the man 's problem is that actually he plant to in a review the check to of the show but she has caught a called uh she cannot be interviewed the man has two options the first one is just interview her after she we covers and post e act occur when the next tissue and the other one is that interviewing an actor instead of the director i believe the second solution is save better idea because if he pos on art occur after the show opening than they articles married that it plays on role like essay trailer does n't main a lot for these reason i believe the second solution is save better idea for his situation
1081,2,the professor talks about um how the lakes disappear with two ways first of all he talks about natural way um usually uh the like is a filled with are not a lot of audience elements and plast uh plants grow and that i and ball down the bottom of the lake and then other real other plants build up their and fill the rooms again and again with s does the same process and second the professor suggest there is a human actively which just each make the like disappear uh when farmer ste every gates plants with a lot of water they usually pop out the water from lakes so unless uh the like is with filled or another streams came to adapt please the like would be try and disappear
1082,2,the reading passage um describe the uh techni agree feet and to show a is the advertisement um uh first show um uh i will needs of uh the product disadvantage and then purse date customer uh with the um advantage to make up uh they the this disadvantage their professor uh uh if uh these did the professor uh stated uh the example uh they could where a uh advertisement uh first uh the woman shou it 's really expensive how ever it 's what 's while because and at last customer save the money with the wrong water water empty
1083,2,well the girl is totally agree with the proposal firstly uh uh and she often uh uh john uh drive year or if uh in the campus and if they are is too much conce uh construction and there is no where uh for her to proper uh to to paper have a car and and uh for example of the of the packing lands uh of the consent le of the construction of the packing lines uh and she and she and she can always uh uh uh uh sur cling um straight and par uh and she uh and to park a car and she is always uh a late for class for these reason and secondly um uh it will uh attain it takes uh such a long time to to uh to complete the construction and in the winter and because uh there are uh though the better is so bad and there is a lot of snow ice is as not this is uh on uh on uh on the land uh on uh on the land and uh it will take longer time to finish and and uh uh she
1084,2,okay there are uh two uh ways uh that uh lakes can uh the peop what uh the first way is uh natural uh that by uh uh a settlements one statements film uh uh a lake and uh by uh by time belei can it 's feel it would layers of statements actor that 's off should the settlements the other way is uh human uh behavior but uh uh for example the home fulmars uh from pu water from uh i like to uh uh to their one forms uh if there is no going to little this lake lake what uh disappear sh the ant that you
1085,2,the students has a problem to finish his at ho about the school play um he wants to we to a professor uh professor is is seek so hm the woman gives uh two salute gives her two solutions uh first maybe he would a wait until the professor to cover and then uh do the into but it we await of tell but he will po town until the next week and second it main two you 'd other professor today but the professor has not mind to say um so if i were the man i will choose the second the per is a um because that uh if wait until the ness we ca n't that we are miss the play and this we ca n't so that is not well well hm and the choose the second plan there is a professor he made prepare well for these interview
1086,2,the speaker the trees uh example of the tell j adverts were advertisement for purse them hands in order to support the reading passage uh uh the advertisement is about a professional cook chat uh is more expensive th buy the ca where of the company then other companies and because is very impending expensive he his his uh uh disadvantages to the company how ever it long turn it actually save more money for consumers because the product has left on were n't see and uh other company can nap promise a left on common thing for their products but this company can cause is a better quality that 's why he cause more
1087,2,i think the best way for an academic assignment it 's cool is a group or in a group break is th very good because it helps you to interact with the company inches either give with you can branch it is very important because you create french is with with the company inches and they can help you provide information for your for your party in the proje you can divide the information and you you can have less information to talk about the produ when everyone gathers is their information you can learn of each information everyone has and the learning would be more effective then if you do learn everything by yourself
1088,2,there is a conversation between students they are talking about a letter of a students about removing old by ex from relax uh the girl thinks that in this is true that uh the uh university should remove the old raw uh bike s from the rocks and and she thinks that it is not really a bad job to remove them because and most of the parts of those box or rusty and then just day fill the space is therefore if they remove those bike sto view be in free space for other students to use and she thinks that university can um um attach and note before removing the buys and uh for example give a period of time to in the uh proble about owners to remove their bike s she says that in this case she want and uh uh put her bike in another building and she will be more comfortable and she wo she want walk to the main hold
1089,2,uh she uh with with the uh letter s uh writers opinion that uh the music building should be open the until midnight uh she thing first of all she think that uh practiced in dorm room is very or knowing other students who were reading in dorm uh because it makes uh know he is even in the very low for for your it is more volume and the other thing is that uh music students uh need to uh practice during the uh during even during the a concert period uh music students uh there are practicing uh and uh in the music building so uh she think that the letter 's opinion that uh the music do they should open and here uh midnight
1090,2,as the first reading passage uh tells information about the advertisement mess at the which is called to review th and play sweet as it 's message is applied to incase it 's way company loses uh they had lines in the second listening passage professor and it 's upright example uh of such a master th with the company uh food parts urn plants uh when as a professional cook she tells that uh at first she was afraid of buying as a product of this company because she did n't see real benefits of search a fight cost but then uh she begins in the advertising uh she begins to explain wheel advantages of this product in the war ground perspective he says that um uh wife time right time plenty is living buys accompli uh source it it would save much more money for the customers than any other products presented owns a market sets uh t present the company used
1091,2,the man he is going to write and i go on the p like and uh he is go he planned to into the directed to know more information on a play then he korean right i but the problem is the director was had it bad cold that day so he could n't make the into you and uh s there is an option that they uh the the man had the ranch the meeting with the believes actor and the actor site yes to any to be willing that day but the problem is maybe the actor when oh tell much in the lect as a always not uh uh a skill as the the director uh add knowing about the whole play so actually month suggest means the boy just uh wait into the the until maybe next week when the place he w along in when the place on the when others know more about a play other direct is um uh i mean inside information words to be interesting to most so he deserves way
1092,2,d a d d d d and do so done di uh d d d d so do dull da den d d d d d do do n't i do do doe he di dull d and it d d d de d do dull d d d d
1093,2,uh the refuse universally in their business world is and awareness of a product disadvantage and use listed listen but they j to providing answer to the given limiting showing so um one television advertisement for parts implants and clearly illustrates this technique uh offer feet them persuade so uh a woman said uh out right that that but in times were expensive and uh the extra but however um she also said that extra cost was worth while because in the long run she was able to save money because of the like they more and so this can pursue read buyers to uh purchase i think parents because of the like they why it
1094,2,uh although some people my sink the she uh children ca can take uh john food and can be and also they can enjoy in watching the television have th eyes math but i preferred uh to restrict ch to re restrict restrict uh advertisement for can be engine food and i think the major advantage of uh such restriction is that uh children without watching such advertisement children will not the man and the man uh require the parents to buy this kind of uh unhealthy food to them and and secondly i think uh a ch uh without seeing this student will come uh concentrate on their on their uh test task and to my cell for example i never watch this kind i i advertisement tv when i was young so i
1095,2,the man the woman are talking a problem that the male effects the man faces and he 's going to write an article about school play but uh the the the the director that he is going to interviewed is sick so uh there are uh two possible solution one is to interview him later and uh delay i but the the article maybe the late and the solution is to interview a and the reading lead the reading director uh i think that the second solution it 's much more desirable because um uh i i list you can have some uh some idea and is it can write something about this uh school play and i think maybe uh most of students they you are looking forward to s easy this article and uh even if they are some drop back that uh the leading actor may only know a a little saying about of the play uh compared to the the directors compared to the director and i think that the man can asked you meet interview with the director and the a ride a second serious to and this and uh uh article
1096,2,d illustrates the technique of re few than persuade perfectly because first it talks about the better not so good things about it and which is the expense d uh much more expensive but they are that they also talk about the good things about it which are li long last thing well i guess long lasting and the lifetime mine de which will replace it in case of damage so it i think it illustrates that techni perfectly because it compensate they bad thing with a very good thing making the project the product a very very good product and my encourage people to to wanting to buy that product to d d d
1097,2,according to the reading better the main propose of the letter is the students one the music building op until night also because uh the is uh in the same way and should to convey she sh an with new that the woman also agree with this uh letter because it is very much since in to the students the students may be busy at the day time and uh during the night then they can practice a lot uh as for them will because many people many students are very interested that music and do uh during the day time they mix te uh due to this using this rooms they it moved may does talk to the other students so if they were hm music buildings are of and at night they may have a they will ge uh get the enough time to practice for any concert a very nee programs they have organized hm d so uh the or man want this uh later to be
1098,2,leading that respond first says about the disad what it is of parts and pants i think that it is more costly than other products uh companies products another operate lecture cheaper also she gives a point later on she comes in the charge that this extra courses world because this companies button plants having to special light one eighty specs the cost world so that they can be replacing it have to pro problems that it gets in the future this clearly take illustrates the technique of if you do n't per slit charge uh technique in the first case she does water disad wanted the project plants and then later on she goes to persuade people about the about it is that each as they making up it 's limitation s like think that it as a like to more ready so that the cost that it 's more it 's work pa than other companies cheaper pos some times
1099,2,many cycle just discovered that there are many types of emotional intelligence first of all their or uh th the emotional intelligence defined as the recognizing there should feeling and next when we recognize this we can control better our emotions therefore it allow s s to behave appropriate to behave appropriate in society situations and the professors daughter has some illustration first she need she would get summer job and very know about word which children and it can next with the are during with her friends about choosing movie
1100,2,well the problem is that the girl is waiting for one of her friend and me and they are supposed to be se see a film together but now and me is not it 's not appeared and uh he just did not response any of his message and the man suggest the girl to leave now uh uh and to go to see the film alone uh but the girl thinks maybe maybe she should wait for another ten minutes but they if she did this uh she will miss the beginning of the film uh well i prefer to leave if i were she uh i will live live emmy alone and to and go to the go to see the film alone because i have no time to way to wait but i'm a can see the film to more
1101,2,the woman has turn about sea exten is the hour of city inst to building they one they want the opening our th not not only tools ninety and but also to the midnight because because is a couple reasons that they want money to be open choosing lay it 's know where to practice after easily nine pm it 's noisy to practice around the people in a dorm also s some people wa sleepy men especially before this concert concert was hel has so many orchestra people already booked the place so it so hard for the other people to pre for the rainfall practicing some music instrument so it would be great if the open now will be a little late so more people can resolve the place for the practice in the future it
1102,2,in my opinion class presentations are the most beneficial um assignment ste firstly because um class pre presentations uh require students to learn public speaking which is often um this recorded in class lectures or other tests or grow projects second of all it uh it a lot students to work on organizations using varie friday of images and various hm to help them convey their taught thoughts an ideas in the most useful useful and effective boy
1103,2,like in my opinion i will choose the place where there are few or no people alone because first a people occurred spee place without people where make me easier to think accordi place is generally considered as a better place to read a ca read also learn it it 's propose to find apart plays to start they 'd when i rese college second year required and uh few people per place uh i where ea easier to for course my energy and the saw th on the problem i'm thinking um and it 's so and as said uh prefer the quite place
1104,2,um the professor mentions to them because of the sub surface of the broke mention is that look motion the first is that uh to th the creatures help uh are able to minimize takes portter to other um to exposure to the high temperature and so that they can uh avoid the city requirement for example um the int dessert clea that cl lectures were uh which is and these are in africa like such as this really whether i can know for around the tree or the sun and is a it moved moved uh move the sun easily and quickly the second is that um the creatures and is is that to capture the play um therefore the clea th you can set up letter this and the ground so quickly uh for example that it 's uh the insects working and uh uh and working in the and uh
1105,2,well i would choose to be uh environmental scientist in the future if i have to choose from the this three because i think and um according to the trend of today the concerning of the environment to environmental issues have thing roaming up and uh the s the s environment signed is may be uh uh uh job with the goods cell unre in the future because of it 's economy value uh and also i think this uh environmental scientist job is a good chance to for you to be a good guy for the uh human human and this qu a good for all the society and the global uh issues so i think i would choose the second one
1106,2,the students opinion is that it will better to make some side or and cutting rap uh but king plays a for cars and uh for student as well as for faculties the first reason she get that she some a very often she had to look for the particles for discuss because that short of what can place and the second reason she give that um the last someone there is the he use source dorm and due to so strong and the students can relate ad um uh in class and then because the side of was it 's covered with small eyes his and other things uh for the reason show it looks a long time to complete their uh classes and work so it it better to make some uh by complains in university
1107,2,the woman 's problems is that she is going you watch the movie with her friend any but uh however uh they have to attract to the time but uh they have own then the time left is not very uh more and uh she cart any but she did n't replied and this movie is very important and so uh the woman the man get the woman two suggestion the one suggestion is that she ca n't go to the go to watch the movie by her thirty another movie tomorrow in the second suggestion is that she can wait tem or may nece uh and in my opinion i think uh the first suggestion is better because the woman has some have many bus they things to do tomorrow so she did n't have time to uh watch the movie tomorrow and however any has time to what another movie so i think uh to go to the time i herself and you go to the watch the movie by self is better
1108,2,de uh was d d i was about a do do n't d d d um does n't because the people people go d d and dull d d with that because they d and to d and de to d and d d d i had to because of the d double die and d d
1109,2,the listening passage um describes uh discussion between uh students uh the woman say d that um her plan was late and she could n't uh s cli per uh much so uh the man said that um she should uh to true to the professor uh because uh they uh because she had to make a presentation father day for this morning and she is a take th because she is dates because she does n't know if as she wants uh that the professor or give uh give the gives uh she um the presentation from other day but i think she should um uh do the presentation uh they this morning because you already prepared uh her presentation and uh she should she should be a good
1110,2,today the professor share a study um are sep sep surface low come mention sub certain look convertion is means that some people work um ground work some people and animals work on ground and some people animals or the enter the ground we have some benefit the bad it and uh to get illustration this the environment and the s uh the professor share his there is some example any cases sap s s surface look a motion have several advantage it first uh animals uh work and or the need can see the pre teacher an s can see the capture and it 's an very say for him from be eaten so the and also they well save ever bridge their operation and very s leave this a very say for the may can protect them a
1111,2,two ways the company can diversify a company device devise diversity find ca uh there are many ways for companies diversify one of them j could be to to find more more products or to appeal to others with develop a new products developing products is to teach there is proc just request parties amount of work and effort they should be weathered if successful which with new products this uh uh there would be more cut more customers and more more customers and more more group a g more uh more group or con another way would be to divide the product into many products like had n't show there 's like sh ample could be condition long side and stuff or their fi the product
1112,2,um the speakers did n't girls uh are talking about uh tells waiting uh that 's jealous waiting for friend he 's waiting for from because she they 're they 're going to get the in the uh to see film but they will the students uh in the class next week so her friends late and he has cooler and uh center both mails and she passed years help what she like you life they are that i go um um if uh do the friend of her that uh he is discussing with this he thinks that she have to go herself and with with her and be there is older uh other uh film but what i suggest to do uh uh generally is to go to the to see the film act uh the cinema and uh live uh voice need to worry uh girlfriend uh friends and uh just go
1113,2,the woman is waiting for a friend uh which is a really late uh because uh they have to go uh to see a movie uh because it 's a kind of um work uh so uh uh a boy your uh is with all and uh uh gives ride two solution she can uh go to this it is the movie uh without her friend or she can leave or avoids make uh according to me uh to roman um should clues uh to sees a film uh with that are friend because uh there there is a lack of f respect from a friend because uh she is very very late and uh i s more invites on worked
1114,2,uh i think uh these are of they said that is only one ot but i think the use paper children is is the most you one thing called it can get an information from the newspaper and the trend is clea can exa me in about the of the news can tell of the people so i ca n't is could be the mostly what into
1115,2,for me it 's very important that uh the parents uh helps the children uh to choose the carry because i think that we are too young to choose uh carry or when uh we have to to do it for example uh ask the has um bike i li i infront uh they they a univer leaning land uh we have to choose our care about will not the well of what out the different uh uh jobs and carrying which is possible so for example my mom uh bro need to uh uh a next bit uh for uh with to show me the different way of and possibility of materials uh which are available for me and for my education
1116,2,so the proposal consists on uh compa on doing the construction during the summer break and um the the the student totally agree because uh for a she gives example of the the less to your a construction which were so the packing and uh she had uh a lot of trouble to talk uh uh how cal and because of the space up the blocking space and everybody has trouble students as professor uh and um so she had to to talk a car in the street and sometimes uh so i late and she face the uh lots of trouble to pads a kind the street and the second uh pro uh a proposal it 's uh ap arguments is uh that uh it take to talk too long too long that because of the snow and uh it in some man 's i will be no problem of weather uh so knows knows no problem
1117,2,the proposal in the le sugges during mov old and used bicycle from the pass call rocks and this poses and because they take too much time so woman actual suppor this proposal she has several points to back up her opinion first of all south advisor really rusty and them is in part so apparently nobody easier for them anymore secondly they actually take a lot of space and some people who really need two parts are bus cause or cannot do that because all the free space is that they can up but all the bus course which are news and she also says that all the it can be confer troubles bus calls demonstration should least for the s tutors also bus cools that will say that all or the woman is at the bus course will removed in two weeks a last they take them bag so these are her points during was about school 's from place
1118,2,the example that also has given about the practice cut as acts cutter holding is uh very um beautiful um the regarding the not decision uh you is uh in habit did n't uh speeches as good as uh who love see it uh it not it 's the family for doing been that is very difficult to get the night so in the bottom she 's and these spells and that for the not distant silly and got the not takes option games it and digs courses in the ground and um secondly place the not inside the halls but um uh as examples get holding um the not so not business same hold their the conducted hundreds are different small small holes in the ground and plays one like each in the whole so that even if the as mammals uh find the uh not that it will have a lot of has a meaning and it ca n't as in the when the they campus going that 's example given this get according
1119,2,uh in the lecture the professor may talks about sub uh sur friends a local motion uh uh according to the professor it is about uh animals which move underground and animals can benefit a lot from it uh firstly animal s can minimize they are exposure to eq stream uh climate uh uh the professor gives side as an example that uh these are the insight hundred deser move spill need the sen so it they can uh ro uh ro kind not exposed to uh uh the extreme high temperature another ex uh another point is that uh animals can capture their parade better uh the example is do the these are uh if there is a as insect on the surface that is uh can move under the on the want without be noticed and the catch the per
1120,2,one place to way i think there is a couple of friends are really important to look and one of that then is that the neighbors need to be friendly so the way you can check that is kind of um working environmen interact in with them before moving into that new place also a good environment it 's needed and by that any in d good places you can go for stu or to hang out with your friends and also parts and nature were you can um breed fresher and refreshing yourself so as long as those um create years are followed you will find a good place to a d
1121,2,i recommend that changes the presentation uh uh as uh at the s s done because uh she 's also tired and the same wide as he was uh uh the co the man convince is trying to professor to take it another day but she he said she 's comfortable with the to take the same day well of she has an hour uh to practice she of with her notes and she said that uh in the cop to make would worker up weaker up um gives are more focus as as well she 's exhausted of the fly delay so he has uh under self to do other this with that 's why she does n't recommend other this you want to do d to do the same the which is done uh uh briefly summarize asian is she i prefer to that she takes she does the presentation just uh which is an hour later which is the same day
1122,2,hm new whole morning nice hm some other reason by late it 's always happened dislike to the the playing other trap them so i thinking universities this alway has a their if there is all which happen so the professor for the project for the students who 's late to be take care of time cause the modern you have um the test them or the fly delay always include in environment light um whether and other some s more details so if some if a students who delayed by uh and the other reasons is not for his them self so it 's possibility so i think they have to carry maybe they have presentation ford stay and they have may can more it with mall and give them credit eq so it 's if if you do the to that the of her from the other students who did it
1123,2,uh the woman treasure discussing about uh way in is n't here uh we know that truly has to go to the cinema to see a movie that uh they uh they will discuss in class and uh in is lay so uh chilly wants to know if she has to go uh drive them time with that her or if she has to wait ma ten more minutes for her george um express his feelings and tell that talk hers tells her to uh girl because uh if she waits uh another ten minutes uh she will miss the beginning uh i will uh uh i agree with what he say is and uh if uh she wo n't be able to see tomorrow she really must see the movie now and do not wait for any uh moreover amy is someone the is often mate so it when be uh problem to tell her uh her opinion
1124,2,effect close of friend f my and ask me a p uh a good girls characteristics of neighbors would uh prefer to the end i would recommend him to live in a quite unknown populate to ne per had um this is this is definitely my plays real live and i live in a quiet and i had of in a que ice plays with less population and it has main and it has me in facilities that can be good for living in um i would prefer are living i would advice them to living in the same place that i live in for the several reason which is professor it it 's it 's has
1125,2,uh some people like to stay proper places well there are other people around other prefer to history him place whether feel a no people well for myself i refer study in place where you know people around me because is help me to focus or focus more immerse during and i usually be distracted when they are s out or people around me in my s during time so to s people read make me cannot story more effective play like early myself
1126,2,the woman 's problem is the her i with the late because a pare whether so uh she state all nights and she has the history class today which has to the read presentation or her paper there are two solutions to a problem the first one is to tell the pro professor rescheduling and second one is to crack the copy in my opinion i think it 's perform a to choose first choice for point reasons the first reason is that his the the professor will understand her situation uh if she uh tells her story strictly uh the professor well accepted and uh have a they go she rehear and second lees she can do the re presentation order days uh if she has deal with the professor that she will going to specific topic war do the more on the work the professor will uh on what 's that it the these are the two reason why woman should choose the first shops
1127,2,the speakers are discussing about uh one of from who actually came to the campus lead because of her flight being the lead to do storm so and they are of one of the speaker has uh presentation due which is actually an hour aware and she is talking about the fact that she 's really tired and she does n't know she can give the presentation and then her friend helps her of asking i if he good or she if she could postpone the presentation i recommend she gives a presentation write on the same day because she for for for for the first think she 's actually prepare for it because she 's she explains about that shape uh choose ready by looking or as a long time ago shoes ready pe the previous week and also for the fact that she has a lot coming up the next week and if she is ready for it and why not she should actually glare and give the presentation right now and them have more time for her feature coming up homework assignment
1128,2,out to for to study in a big place would or repaired art people are not around and that this way would be able to communicate and exchange ideas for example being in a library which is a public place be all you be able to their be beneficial from the people around for example uh the uh the library system cho help you uh communicate with other students uh sharing this studying on the same subject it should be able to help you and it 's a bad way uh of learning it 's it 's uh instead of being isolated and uh having to do everything on around the will get more help being people and and a public takes
1129,2,the problem here is chilly s waiting for friend and she wants to go together with her to see a film and it 's for school cause they with school talk about it in school and she already wait to th and fifteen minutes and she has two leaves soon because otherwise she where um use these that of the film so the guy gives uh the advice to even well voice made an have phone and and to go with how to her in my opinion it 's that with choice because if she were wait for another attend minute she will be too late for the film she will miss the beginning and any could go to the film tomorrow and her own while the guy uh uh the glare chilly tend next time tomorrow and it 's important for school and important for the profess uh source she has to court now
1130,2,actually agree with the with the statement i think parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a career that really important and parents um often know better them their children on what career to choose um and they have to consider also their abilities and uh and what their children are interested in but it really important from them to uh more in take uh in guide their children in in a career i think my example it 's one of the exams i can i can support this opinion because i i think i was not guided well and i could choose another career for myself
1131,2,emotional intelligence means people can loan the look good cause of our uh feeding and king can so that they are behavior in sources to teacher is n't so rev they can maintained they would relationship to with others uh in the lecture the professor the listened uh an example of a store to he start or one it 's uh active we we with her friend uh about which moon moving to watch but up other let that she star he start uh freak out why she well she was so annoy because she she were was worrying about the new job he take and and what she one make may missed uh no annoy is know we see for him but just about her uh worry of uh new job so letter there a product to her for and uh and and get her her perfo as a certain s so reasons away example how people can can sorry uh it harry an
1132,2,the most important kind of distract of a good neighbor heard that i shirt uh suggest her or have uh kind of whole which is very in the other two has are heard institutions where he studies or are uh a good a good whole which would need the need of that friend like uh the best to be mark should be near or to the whole like they medical uh facility should be nearer to the you know unlike a educations you should should be near to the of and anything which comes uh uh a which comes in daily life we we feel that they are necessary the should be there are two the home and uh he should be uh a good a good a bird um would be that activity with other kind something we necessary
1133,2,the reading describes emotional intelligence emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize a process to feel true feelings and to understand what is causing them and by having a marks more emotional intelligence you can actually control ch are much more p response i am have very relationships the professor mentions the example of her daughter in a situation when he when she managed to develop to demonstrate her uh emotional intelligence heard other inviter friend her has to see film and they both start arguing about well what film to see then he 's that are stopped i realize that the problem what the problem was not what movie he they want to see but he he was stress about something else so he 's top an a public test
1134,2,i think the most important cracked or is to more good neighbor food his first should be quite it 's because we as student uh are are mean job is to study and study required a quite environment so chose of quite never who 'd is very important the second is uh uh never to should be uh friendly because well way we were always facing a problem wi will in life and uh never who 'll should be the person who can help me at the first time so uh the never food to be friendly is very important uh that 's it that 's all
1135,2,well announcement from university says that uh the university is going to change the plan of construction from uh from um um to the summer for two reasons first um uh uh is so uh these uh these constructions so disruptive so and they need to uh uh man in the uh uh you meetings li second um uh if if they were in a summer they can comple faster um when the woman in the conversation a po uh suppo support this p uh plan for two reasons first yeah uh uh the bend full and uh construct uh really need to be uh improve the for example uh their packing loss are too crowd and then uh it hard found uh uh placed pack their class second uh there are you uh if they work in as a went or the the snow can can slow down the conc on the process of construction with his know good for for a um the rep uh in mend of construction
1136,2,well in in this lecture the professor introduce in deduce two benefits of the surface look my motion uh first uh it 's can save them a lot of energy uh um for example there is a lees are th in a uh africa hm they they they 'll they use of the surface uh a sub surface a look motion to to helps to help them save energy and they do n't need to hear exp rose uh to the high temperature uh weather second um uh it is good uh it is good for them to capture predators uh for example um take a listed us example so hm they they a serve they the movie in the on a surface and uh they have very high sense or of the w library sh an hm of the send so they can catch the predator very easily very is um that 's all thank you
1137,2,uh okay one ce ce choosing an good place leaves you should consider if it is close soon the places you usually go liked it job or the place work or the place is study uh living close by the places it will everyday is really important because it it cook uh uh reduce the time is band uh at at uh add distract friends it if and even and a car or maybe on the bus uh i think uh also a good thing to look for his uh if the
1138,2,parents should be are important a process of helping their children to choose a career is very true because uh have more experience and they do n't want to suits you you know what is uh so to to in the future uh the sarah notes me bec while sh uh the wife select in my career is they have need to select are very she and assigns they say listened ca my english is good and i my am gotten science and does n't i find it 's uh a breakable for me i like science and i got had was that so it was good for me to have at home but uh uh are
1139,2,emotion intelligence invented ability talk talk my c feeling and this causes of some this may cause um to have good relationships between people and the sport this is a bill from source number of the professor he could he gave a example office daughter which are grow and use her friend about seen the movie but uh and this getting poses here but when she do n't was that the problems coming from her decision having someone shop not surround seem the movies to stop such confusing and and so exposal into preference and up into his forest for here and she for better flex it and seemed moved to pos
1140,2,hm the the first way is always earth 's surface what 's or is to a wait to be exp waters to extra your club it 's uh for example uh the reason and uh after the rain to his sub surface and it tell voice had to be students to her help deserts her s credit and the second point is uh uh it makes it to be easy to test or the food for example uh he can fill library from of that some insects and she and it saturday op deaf ad take after the big the very easily that 's the second point
1141,2,the following statement it 's really popular i now there is no i f it 's very difficult to find an real on prop on some in my opinion parents should be involve the process of helping where children to choose a career because first of all we are too young a normal is to the not to young to make such important decision and they can do it like based on their patient and they a whole bees another thing is that when choosing a korea parents should like make make the pros and cons for each of job and profession and to find the best for his child and over that really sitting of her and will be profitable
1142,2,more swarm intelligence is uh the understanding of of what could holds the emotions state and what people they waters wants to and some of the individual uh uh an lecture be another professor was uh about explaining his daughters uh recent experience with the but when they try to watch a movie they got in wild an an are given and hm is daughter got pretty of side about then they devil g thought about that she discover that she would n't upset with uh but it partly with that about something out that interest uh it it you with the pla the ten she was of that one they she recently took up uh children counseling job and she was very and sh is and she wanted to go well and she was expressed about it and her spread river under water respond then she did n't planned to when she and start there she stop and she explained that to a plant and depends got better for her
1143,2,students announced it means in good relationship and courage is called addition she moment plays an a bit to control students from the example from the lecture illustrated actually it 's busy and uh and and uh if films are motion hours been i did in the example that the daughter was was able to control lab emotions to go to maintain good relationship a friend chose bees privately pass clea bothered about a new job and so much of but she had made the job common to watch she was plain other present to wash they wash did was us to in actually get back to a senses and you know a product of friend and to necessary corrections to her and uh it 's if he if he help time because she got a lot of and quite meant for my friend and halle about one she got of with it
1144,2,yes they should be involved because sometimes parents know the careers more than their children they should you the might voices for what they career uh is they should know well they know our more about the sun they should see of the career uh will help the or summon future and if it 's going to have hm and giving his life they should they should talk to hand they should advice i am they should see of the career firts them the children one they should see in the copy uh as they uh they should see of the copy it was a people was but term to have the scary uh
1145,3,the proposal of the letter is that advi advisors should be not and it on a required means that information audi given in the web about the new um see messed so a lot of students do n't have enough time to make an appointment with an advisor and it 's very hard and it 's very to get an appointment so they do n't have free time the opinion of the boy is that um at the website the s they are just basic information so it he disagrees with the opinion of the girl who wrote the letter and um he said that advisors help to figure out um things why a graduation and gives she edge extra information um and that you do n't have trouble to make meetings if you do n't wait too long so he thinks that they are important for the school
1146,3,well two important points i am about containers of products to make them more um uh to make the more interesting for consumers to buy is um uh first to make the container is use friendly as possible for example uh nearly liquid products is for example mustard of ketchup should n't should be as solved in in user friendly containers and because advisor would be quite messy to use must for ketchup a table and to another important point is that the product should be should have a pleasant appearance for example cookies could be solved better and decorated metal box instead of plastic container because than the consumer uh hm is more interested in buying it because it the grades home sw
1147,3,the epiphytes use house trees to first for it takes no nutrients from the from the suppor tree but it 's gain access to sunlight from it uh because they he is has n't has any nutrient so it needs special making them to survive the urn plant bring just uh on the cannot cannot be first pour uh uh it is it has a bowl uh borrow like shape do it is that holds water house water and uh this water contains uh this will day some kind of a early wh fertilizer because it consist of many hm nutrients that is wash down from the leaves of other plants that and uh it is you start in the bowl so it bend the nutrients can seep into the leaves and five a survive
1148,3,the book that i'm very interested in the thing that i have not yet is the last simple by them her example uh and the splitting reading this book is because his previous books mainly the da vinci code it is to focus well her uh historical background along with something happening in the person so this ability to relieve their past events with that the current events in the fiction it 's actually really talking so they keep the little into till they variant book um looking forward to read the last simple and uh have do hold that it would be as into singers his previous want d
1149,3,i want to read a book a lot of the rings because i 've seen the movie and uh i want to read uh read the book and i want to compare with the the book and uh movie course same to save or not and i also wanted to read the book because i wet hits the first solution of this book that is the hope writ written by talk ins so in hop it i films ste there are so many characters like the build build learns and so uh because of or this and what has happened i want to read the book uh i try to books but uh it 's very expensive and it 's a very take book so according buy the book but i because of after reading the hop it 's
1150,3,um i would consider myself as one of those people who prefer not to carry the cell phone all the time um that 's the to the fact i i 'd really due like be out tours for example um i like to go hiking an like like to go work landing in the area close my home town and i really do enjoy the the quietness student uh the the silence um one it is that that search actions and also think like ride at uh while doing this things that i do n't really need to talk to people of the time if they have something important for me they could right me male but uh my cell phone that 's on the for important things
1151,3,the book i would like to carry lead to read probably are ready at his little brings um on watching doing with students very was very interesting and actually like ten s i do as what from my friends and so that i i another believe that if agreed all the parts not who enjoy ex like they got uh interesting everything is just buy and i believe that the wo they would of the spells this said no direct me some of them the receive it 's they
1152,3,well there is a book that i have an read but it seems to be very interesting and i we really would like to read as an as i have a time to do this the book is called the fis station and it was re uh reading by uh the writer called know where golden he 's an english writer it 's an awful based on the life of uh decision from the the best the me the media each for something it must be very interesting because it tells about the struggle of a young boy with no means to achieve his streams
1153,3,uh there are main interesting book so which i have ever read and put time a lot of interested is one of this is about the animals wife ab interesting about this book because uh it 's uh i ca n't i can if i read this book uh uh about doing was thing uh i wi uh while one animals while the animals second were n't what about knowledge about how to how a borrow their wi friend about uh their way of um giving and uh how they um key uh um find some food uh it 's um it 's uh really very uh interesting good to gets and knowledge about while during knows so uh that 's why i'm interested in a reading books about them and uh host the probably i would do it 's uh some day
1154,3,though students a a kind of perform um a rock and roll band in the in the schools auditorium but uh and they trying a reserve the other trying for the next couple of weekends but it are already uh fully booked so they are going to s performer either on a wednesday night in the middle of the week but that would be a problem because there will be a smaller audience but at the same time and be something guy into teen in to do will um or in the middle of the week or just perform with the another band on a saturday night but there will be another problem they would be another problem that are just going to minimize the number of some that uh that they would perform uh and but in the other hand they uh uh a bigger audience will be uh they are watch um i recommend to do on a saturday night because um more audience will be there and um in my opinion if they are doing a close something it will be better with or audie
1155,3,okay epiphytes have the characters of climbing uh high trees to their branches or trunks and reaching the highest positions was do i will sunlight for photosynthesis in case of urn plant they have a specific modification in their leaf structure which allows them to form a bowl uh or or a final cone shaped structure which allows the collect of uh rain water thus the major requirement of water is uh sufficient sta made available s then for the nutrients uh the the trap insects or dead leaves which gets de graded in the water and thus provide a reach source of nitrogen thus uh the the rich like to them so ste which like to them source uh de give metal uh act as a liquid fertilizer for it 's growth
1156,3,as a product product itself important but also the container to uh it like the container it might be the want factor that uh that that influences the consumers deciding which product by at there 's few ways to make uh container uh d feeling first one is being user friendly the container should be uh convenient for n using for example uh the plastic container for ketchup or other sauces it 's what example uh in the pass kind sources were and glass with let 's but it was very messy and not easy to use the next next uh the next way to be good for container is having a pleasing a pick the parents better
1157,3,engine girl lie can as in forest uh the canopy is dense so uh some uh the epiphytes like the urn plant has to use the uh a host uh to get the sunlight uh they uh use the tree as a support um they uh urn urn plant and other epiphytes develop that develop different uh mechanisms uh to store right to store water uh with a unique shape of their lives uh long leaves and uh uh they uh use the decompose uh other is the decomposition of the other leaves uh as food and uh it or made uh they are made them to survive in the in the p hard condition
1158,3,uh the well it 's easy and to lead the can fit cause wearing is uh was caring his uh mobile everywhere um i would have my mobile with me am totally addicted just for to talk with many friends my family or just to listen the music uh i need to to uh for my child as well because is my all the client can reach me with me on my cell phone so it makes the that the might have really easier and uh well like i and reason why people can live without it but yeah than my life
1159,3,there 's creaming things that show how the urn plant has adapted to the life and the rain in the rain for the first thing is that it grows up an tree and they are upper part so it has the chance to get some sunlight and to grow and oh the second thing is that it 's leaves form a kind of bowl and um they therefore they 're able to collect and store water because the water fall the p on the leaves in them says collected in the lower bowl uh third thing is that um the unique shape of the leaves also helps to um gather some nutrition for the plant because if insects land on the on the leaves they fall into the boy well and they will being uh used for nutrition he 's
1160,3,uh i to refer to uh well uh um have and bring my uh cell phones with me all the times and all over the place that i go because i think int uh emergency a tuition uh it can be so useful for example uh emergency nutrition cause the for your job your parents your sister or your family and something like this and they ca n't find easily or even for example emergency for you you can uh for example call hm mind one one or call to and be humans and something like this and if you do n't have with you can use it as fast as it would be um it if it 's better to have
1161,3,i prefer to have my cell phone all the time the me as i feel secure in the city i lid um there is not much security the s i need to have my cell phone all the time incase i crash with another car in case i i get um also that or something like that and moreover i like to have my cell phone with me because uh for work matters it 's very useful as you get to communicate with your colleagues when you whether house during the time traveling to the job or even i did n't so i am connected to work all the times
1162,3,the man uh is not um okay with the proposal that he where in the newspaper as he uh move the proposal is about um says that the the university should eliminate them they academic advis or advisors schedules so um to select courses and we come and and and give advice for the requirements for graduation and that the there should be eh and because they are the information is in the web and it 's very difficult to get to meet with the academic advisors and the man is not he does n't like this and because he says that the advisors have a lot of extra information that there is not available in the web and that they can help you with us with coming graduations and that you can schedule early to get the place
1163,3,the urn plant is a top epiphyte which has uh managed to develop certain stretches to get nutrients and it usually wraps its roots around the trees around the host trees and now um its leaves have um if there is special in unique shape and they form a receptacle in which water can stored in from watch other plant can get the nutrients in and now um not only the of the plant get water gets of water from this um uh this water from this um normally as a plant get water from from this receptacle but also other nutrients because sometimes insects um are washed down into the receptacle and they decompose and from those decomposed insects plant is also able to get the nutrients it
1164,3,usually prefer in my cell phone with me at all times because uh than i'm able to contact my friends and uh my colleagues admire work place uh it 's also provides pay the sense of security in that 's i'm always rude able to reach other people if uh something an expected should happen of course you have to me member lacks uh your cell phone does n't always have coverage if you are friends ins at see or up in the mountains uh the only time that i do n't have my cell phone with me is uh when i'm out running because i have a very old cell phone and it simply to have a to run we it 's at as that would uh be uh disadvantage for my uh running
1165,3,as that scheduling a meeting with your advisor is hard to do because you do n't know always have a lot of th free time and also you can find the sing information in the web page but then the student says that it 's not the same because in the web page you only have basic information but on the advisor could help be fig route so many things that you ca n't find in the web page it could also help you to solve any appear problems and he says that you wo n't experience a scheduling problem if you will go early so that then he will have a lot of time to schedule your appointment if you go in the last minute of course the what have a lot of free time to schedule at
1166,3,in the lecture the professor talks about urn plant to explain how epiphytes have adapted to the life in the rain first um epiphytes are hos plants and uh who use the trees or trees trunk and branches of trees to as the platform for growth urn plants urn plant writ around trunk or branch of a tree and recycling in the tree to get the sunlight uh because uh it got it 's lane because it 's leaves look like urn is or bowls uh they have spiky leaves which is like a cone shape and using their old shaped leaves they collect rain waters and they may you get or other nutrients um that that animals went on their leaves and they get washed off and there are store th on the water and and take it a pro decomposed and then they will be a nitrogen which but for the urn plant
1167,3,in the lecture the professor actually proposed two ways that uh the products container can be designed to appeal to consumers one of the example is plastic containers which is used to hold ketchup or uh concert uh because is flexible and uh uh most or use or fun and user friend it to just to squeeze the bottle to get the ketchup out for example uh instead of the glass uh container they had in the past and so this is a user f with this the wo appeal to customers and also the pleasing appearance may uh grow uh attract customers by a certain product for example in the lecture mention that the cookies or replace in the nice metal box for decoration instead of a plain cardboard to look nice and classy propose the consumer and also for the guests d
1168,3,i prefer to use a cell phone all time because you can use for example in an emergency case for example uh in helped great you can culture that uh they 're always happening there the cd or bring a crime or some of my tiny con call the police uh you can uh use prefer to have the cell phone all time because i can communicate with my friends because some of them with my am so it is perfect to some message and receive mess it from them e and to communicate all time all the places and i can use it what one when they want uh is use the phone was live by not one is the phone all time i prefer to do it like that
1169,3,the first example is heron thing a box which is made user friendly and convenient to new s and and the text is used the example of uh uh a plastic bottle for ketchup or mustard because it 's more flexible and use and it just of to squeeze a no really release the lid first and it 's easier to use faster and more convenient in the second example it 's uh demonstrated at the example of uh cookie box which has a pleasant appearance and so it 's nice to display and they use example come comparing metal boxes with picture uh uh to the plastic bo uh the printed for them boxes before so it 's better an attractive more classy is nice it to present if you 're foods it is coming over newer present uh give them some cookies to eat
1170,3,there 's a new work rome the has informed and there are they are searching for it de when they can perform especially on a weekend at the auditorium but the auditorium it 's bec by do all the weekend stu they they did the they they the start date of the summer so these two hos two solutions in front of them the first one is to perform in the middle of the week and they they have uh they did they maybe it 's more audience or the the second solution is to pay phone at the beginning of another groups performance on a weekend watching for me the best solution akon recommend to them is to perform your best songs during the they they weekend at the other the other groups performance so that they can other for them to be known and the next and they can perform well
1171,3,well in the speeches actual about the thing the band and preparing for a performance and uh the guys playing guitar and they making music the grew please uh pretty in he want know it actually knows th so far but they want to have a performance pretty so so uh hm before they they plan ending than before the summer uh before everyone go well the campus uh but there is only uh next couple weeks well helps old and that is kind of the problem and they wanted to take auditorium because a music is very well so now they want to book on hand but it is already booked for couple of uh and days and they plan ending that maybe on the middle of the week but not everyone way able to co uh and they have a smaller audience or to perform her with another group um but they wo n't have enough time how prefer to performance uh in the middle uh with another group because uh it 's were said and would be more fun and they would get more audience and they wo n't be a supported
1172,3,as for the company me to stay that uh uh like the fair uh uh for uh or a cell phone and telephone to be with me wherever i go uh on the one of the main reason i think that parents are family will be app is really over uh if you are an emergency o energ of and i think that happen cha resting the well do the cell phone all phone to taxi parents are family ant i think is very important thing to they should within or every film incase anything happens
1173,3,a book that i have not read but is interesting it reading with it people call the prince by make low mark and only because first it could increase the chance of me entering a university since the subject i want to major would be world history the prince is considered eat bible involve history i reading the book i believe taking he is my chance of entering college because doing interviews the professors will uh ask about it the stating uh it is a basic knowledge that every student should ha set now second not only would improve my chances entering college but it will help improve my writing skills so the plants is a letter the recent looking uh it has for a she and when when widens by reading it i can learn useful was an expressions therefore these are the reasons why the prince would be a book the wants to have interest
1174,3,first the concept uh epiphytes is is speeches a plant that uses a host plant as a platform for growth in the lecture the professor talks about how the plant species urn seventy first urn is have cutter names because they 're least form an urn urn or a bowl first uh the urn is have adapted to life in rain forest because there long with our support it i wraps around the trees trunk or the tree branches uh since their leaves have uh because there is like in these have she go go funnel they can use that to collect water from the bowl and after other nutrients to specifically since the insects or their leaves get an side uh they watch down and they decompose uh concrete and they cannot old cup decomp ocean a the insect the dead nice the pour nutrients which can be used as a becau uh liquid fertilizer for the urn s that can be used to uh support the ro therefore these are the reasons how earth have adapt as life in the rain forest
1175,3,the urn plants use us plants to access to s to get access to sunlight colors um it 's to dark down on the errors uh they um grow up the other plants to get to sunlight and the problem is that they get no nutrients there are so that 's why they have be unique formation of their leaves which is looks like a bowl and can collect water so um the wa the rain it 's collecting and their ands on the same time they are nutrients from other plants falling in there so it 's some kind of water supply uh was a liquid fertilizer and so the urn plant can get nutrients whenever it needs to um it on the same time his sunlight so that 's why it adapted to the life in the rain forest really prof business ow
1176,3,roman pro product the not only buy the product but the containers to two ways of designing a products cleaner are the first uh i think the needs to be kept in mind is that the container should be use as user friendly as possible flexible plastic containers are very convenience satis ketchups or past this container another important design goal is that the container should have a pleasing appearance it should appeal to the consumers and also attract or tends than for example containers for cookies must be instead of using a cardboard box for con uh cookies uh uh metal box can be used with nice pictures on it so this way the container will look nice and classy and attract the consumers and also when the consumers of the cookies to their guest in the house it look nice
1177,3,well the book i would interested to read that have a let 's or for it 's hard to buy the on hours it 's supposed to be a book about the pad assigned is will conflict but about how was a strictly so about another just about the reasons uh thinks that happened over there but about the history and how it happened that it 's her move their it out and first great um the it actions very teenager pers and people and i'm really interested in this book because of generally it has some politics as a study politics not a special interest and uh well and which of pad assignment is trail and therefore when interests me specially while lesser so big conflict between uh with bring the different populations in a when a lot not know about it
1178,3,well there 's two ways that a products container can be designed to appeal the ca n't consumers the first one is that the user friendliness uh the lecture is giving example about for example things like ketchup they were from upper than glasses so you need to put amount was a spoon to just try to get and some other way over your food so it was not really good to use especially custard lot of time a long time to get a letter off so finally they came up with plastic containers which are flexible as you just ca hold them above your food squeeze a be any comes out nicely so they were much more user friendly at the second uh option is uh that they really need to be appealing and look good s af example putting cookies a nice metal box will be much nicer and much more decorate of for people they can present a nicely to people instead of just putting them and uh would n't books are not good looking box uh
1179,3,as know the in the letter he offer argues that it is unnecessary t require students to meet with the academic advisors before beginning of the semester in the conversation the man is showing his frustration about this letter because first of all he thinks that it is not the same thing that going to the advisor is equal to going to the university website to check the schedules since they are made different ways and professors and a lot of information on the courses students can get advice in a good way and select their letters or their courses and also about the schedule meeting is not a problem the man states that only the students who wait until the last day to form a schedule the appointment habit difficulties schedule the meeting but ever he states that students should actually form or go to the office to schedule in the beforehand you know to prevent discouraged problems
1180,3,the book that have not read but interested in reading is the harry potter cities my take a long link for many reasons first reason being my phone store me that the harry potter cds have improve the sentence imagination to things because they read the book many times and each time the book meant new to them when compared to the before and the main reason and the second main important reason being the in other nation would create essential reflection it me as an architect i will bring own and move for the in my in my a new projects improving the scent of imagination and me and creating good groups to my future hand the above reasons i like to real the read the harry potter series by take a rolling
1181,3,the man does not agree with the professor in the letter and the proposal in the letter was there is not need of um for the students to meet the advisors when the so much information in the website available and it is difficult for the student to schedule a meeting with the particular lecturer ad advisor and the man holds the reasons that they are they are very different ways that i advisor can help the student in different reason making the choice of a perfect class because the advisors are always extra information with them and the second thing being schedule a time is will not be a problem because if you just go early into the offers ant schedule it would be an easy job then waiting for the last even own of the schedule are open for other students to to continue so i feel that the man is not agreeing with the proposal for these to particular reasons and he thinks that advisor is very good choice for the students in helping them choose the classes they are going to opt in their graduate
1182,3,i would like to read the book by ride one reason where would like to this book is that i have already seen the movies in the cinema i think that it wri write has a nice story and also my scared the for example tele the girl who first a lot of the vampire and advi ad who is the went pile and that 's really looks good um but i like to read the book um additionally to the to seen have seen the movie as a book always have of more information and i think it will be very interesting to hear new staff in the did you stuff in this book of well
1183,3,the boy is part of band and they are ready to have a concert they want to play in the campus auditorium but this is already booked for the next weekends when solution would be to play on wednesday in the middle of the week rather option is to play with another band which has booked the auditorium on a saturday i think um waiting for the wednesday and um playing in the middle of the make is the better option i think this because then they have more time to um perform and then they will be better in their songs and additionally if they wait they can play all of their songs furthermore i think it 's better for band if they play alone in the auditorium so that they kind convince the um people that they are good band
1184,3,the pro the problem situation is that the man is group is having a concert and the campus auditorium in which uh the man school will be help in their concert it 's booked for next few weeks he has two solutions to this problem one is to do it during the weekends in which the concer uh campus audi tom is pre and other is to join another band on saturday night and we can in which you he and his band note in my opinion i think should go with the option of plain and wednesday when the campus auditorium is read because if he plays in saturday with the other bands banks band would be able to play all the songs that they had practiced which would make it and meaningful for what all the cracks this instruct wa in order to make the best out of themselves even though to my have smaller audiences if he would join make it on a wednesday used to be able to perform all the songs that his band is practice for such a long time
1185,3,i would wealthy keep cell phone with me all the time if i had a choice big because first of all for me it 's a good way to be reach by your friend or your family uh over time when they want and whenever you weathering know for me it 's um also a good way to take photo of e they 'll when you know traveling or working down the street you know find something we nice you can keep or memory of what you of sen um for instance my parents likes uh reaching me everyday and my phone to have some use because it 's not so easy to reach me
1186,3,i'm interested in reading the book called the sea could written by public where though i'm interested in reading this book as i 've heard it will influence to adapt the way a lot towards life well planned my future and the general move my way of living my la um my she uh my future of influenced by this book since this book deals where the pos it a bus to buy it with the future and to a taking decisions thus might or distance books based upon the fact that that this book with me taking taking decisions more positively and in uh in and sh in chain in my uh chain in my life start watch towards the past of attitude that enables my success
1187,3,personally i i i prefer having my cell phone with me at all time as my cell phone and it was my connections with my friends and enables uh deeper connection on with my social life and the ch after and my attraction with others uh my cell phone with my means of communication with the people around me and sometimes this essential for uh it is essential for meet to speak with them or it might be important so i ca a so therefore i have to use my cell phone and i prefer having it with me instead of uh instead of uh relying another means of communication as the cell phone shortens distance and space and uh th enables me to communicate with if person which is uh nearby
1188,3,well the speakers are discussing um a new band and s possibility is to play before summer uh they want to use the campus auditorium a space as a uh place for the band to perform but it 's already booked uh the coming weekends before summer then he is um presenting two option which is s they can play on wednesday but the people so in a small audience um all they can play on next saturday with some friends already perform in the auditorium and but then they will would have that much time uh i would recommend they played on the saturday even though they do n't have that much time but then they can just pick the best songs an ant perform them that better than nothing
1189,3,steve discusses that they have a pro his band has a problem uh scheduling his concert since they are new a new band they wanted to do will concert for the school before the summer ants however the auditorium that in which they wanted to perform act is already booked for the rest of the week in months before summer um there are two options for his band wants the book play to play ger in wednesday night which you with ch could invol the smaller audience he does n't want to because he wants a bigger audience the second option is to perform with another band on a saturday but then there would mean no enough time for them to perform personally i think that the second option is that or to perform with another band during a saturday night like what he says saturday night mind of all a bigger crowd and although they made they my perform for shorter time at least they can have perform a low in the big audience which would appreciate them
1190,3,the letter another 's paper says uh proposes that meetings with the advisor should not be required it 's his that the information is available on the well and also that there is a uh difficulties with scheduling um uh of the means would be advisors the man is say does not agree with a propo with the proposal in a new split to paper he says that the website information is available but is very basic and then advisors help another ways they helped requirements for graduation that a person might not be aware of they have extra information that they can share with um students and he the man also states he 's never had a problem with scheduling that the student who is complaining about problems especially probably his that to glass meant when the professor schedules are already booked but lot of different to it 's
1191,3,the earlier uh written by home or is and novel which i am very interest in interested in in reading first of all it is a book the adver court history of the children more and there is no other talk humans and available in book or in the internet that describes the war asked detailed as the novel the earlier does also really it is regarded as a very classic and gives me the station that i feel small away and this is why i want to read daily it
1192,3,well as the man said uh uh he disagrees who uh the letter uh all the opinions of the students was really in the letter in the newspaper letter uh his his ideas or his um reasons for bring this i agree is that because uh there are just basic there is just basic information on website and um if there are some completed question questions about taking classes or scheduling um um the website cannot cannot help very well and there are some like he has n't had trouble with asserting appointment we cancers and things those who have problem uh have the lady peop uh way to the last day does a none point so they should wait for do everything and the glass movement uh there are some extra there is uh some different classes for song that just it counselors notes and that 's all the recent month
1193,3,there are two examples fir containers to for the for design for containers to in the con consumers the first example is for plastic containers for example ketchup and ketchup was sold in glass containers your during to read and pour the ketchup out which is which was uh firs not comfortable not convenien for users weather when they use bad thing things for ketchup it is more convenient the more attractive way to use the ketchup on your food that we could just use the plastic borrow the space the ketchup out and do it in the reading my uh idea neat way another example is the cookie is if someone were to so to sur cookies and just simple random plastic bag they would n't be opinion an want want to show them in their house whether a few circle is an a nice decorated metal box will be more encourage to buy the cookie is and display them in a house with people come over and um you serve them cookie is that the and the student cookies
1194,3,i have n't read the the book menu me um i think it would be a good idea or to reach such book because um i'm interested about all the bus that is currently um being taking on about this book because of the reason cinema adaptation um i think i would like it because it 's about the adventure um and uh i think it would be really interesting for me because it 's a best seller as a book so probably uh the hm the book may be very nice and also um the cinema adaptation um has been uh a block plaster and i think um books are always better than
1195,3,the two major ways uh that a products container can be designed to appeal to consumers uh are are that then the container um has to be as convenient as possible to use for the consumer but also has to be the design has to be attractive uh so for example if you buy some ketchup it 's uh much more convenient faster and easier to use if it 's in a flexible plastic bottle uh then in a glass bottle where you have to remove leads before being able to to to eat it and uh also the design has to be really attractive to appeal to consumers it 's something really important because um for example it 's uh it 's for some food it has to look attract it and it can get added fully to the product
1196,3,and my opinion i think that uh and these new band should just take of the weekends uh so it will get their they will get more attention or get more people which means there are also commerce commercial live in the band and when they are more people uh it 's kind of chain reaction so people comes in city yeah the concert will you know there the let other people know outside of the concerts and i think peri the band and gain more uh more attention and more friends and even though they their only plain for short time uh still at the very good uh graduate market yourself out there and uh the week this just one read it is there is an is not there wo n't be any uh people i mean it 's a middle of the week everyone 's uh school or taking classes are doing something else and at the weekend just seems like a perfect time the uh the play or to perform have for a concert
1197,3,he a uh urn plant which is a type of acco uh an epiphytes uh have that that to life in the rain forest by wrapping its would around the uh around the tree trends around the tree itself for support uh and and they so it can listed cell phone in the canopy they gain sunlight and name comes from it shape uh unlike tell gain water and nutrients and so it 's kind like a bowl and uh has a a long spiky leave and which means that any dead insects or a other uh dead like organism can fall into the uh a bow shape leaf dvds by do even and it turns into the new nutrients uh decomposed so it can store the store water within the uh the plant can uh can uh obtain michael fired uh fertilizer which uh can fill nutrients do the whole plants
1198,3,i bought uh uh but the book and a long time and down the name the book is the office sauce investment habits he is one of a most successful investors in the world know because of the they cannot make um by the financial crisis so many people lost a lot their money in the stuff mike it or some other kinds investment project however for chinese um we have an influence a lot because we had a g happy which is to save their money in the bank however that 's not that good happy forests right now his we need to know how to make the best used in money into make when more and money you know because they play should will lose or
1199,3,in the problems these has is that um he created the band which plays guitar and the thing is that um they are trying to op the place for a concert um which is before summer but uh there are all book that uh in in the campus which is uh no more space for them to play um the only option is um they can play alone in first they night which is going to the middle of the week and there will be a last audience or that he can play with another band which is uh but the weekend um i prefer that um i recommend him to play with another band things that and there will be a lot of uh more uh more audience in we can um for the more the i think uh the first time of performances only uh and in a state experience instead of really performing a so co i recommend him to perform with another band
1200,3,uh is was talking about uh terms of playing in a band as a guitar player and he was discussing with her ph with his friend uh two options to uh to play in public with his pant the two option are during a uh during school week uh on went on next wednesday and the other is to perform with another band uh during the weekend and before uh before summer uh form my hard i would suggest e to play uh on wednesdays sense uh it 's uh it 's them there f first cancer there are not used to it and they can have more time to practice and to get used to the scene so this could be a lot of fun for them and playing with another band could make them appear less good then the really are
1201,3,substantial problem dance face in the rain forest is the lack of sunlight at the bottom of uh uh of the bottom of the trees now one strategy to cope with that is to use host plants to to actually higher over the benefit of that is to get a lot of sunlight the problem is that on the other and you do n't get a lot nutritions an example p research of plant is the urn plant which wraps around branches of trees thereby characters that sunlight of high uh it 's strategy to catch a n' freshened is is to have stiff s by key leaves that one have form kind of bowl or no learn and in their water is clack also insect another animals or attracting there and they decompose bodies can be used by the plants to be bad itself
1202,3,uh so the problem of the rain forest is that uh um apple trees cover um the program plants to the from some some sunlight and uh but uh epiphytes uh develop a solution to to to adapt so they use um uh host plants to uh as a platform to grow they they grow on a part of the trees weather is plenty uh plenty of sunlight um they are called epiphyte uh urn plants and uh hm uh there is ask something because of the fact that she have uh a cone shape uh to a unique shape to get the water and to get the nutrients they haves of the spiky leaves to to get the water and nutrients so there is um what uh the food solves and um it creates a water supply um to to be reason nutriment compliments
1203,3,steve is a guitar player uh um and he uh likes to play uh a concert voices band um the problem that he has um is that he wants to make a performance before the summer but uh in the auditory in where he wants to make the performance there are only uh free time s during the week hm there is on solution there are of um they have friends in another band they have uh are uh perform and settle that the week and uh there are discussing to uh let them play with them but they have only a show the time i prefer the second sta at the second solution because playing at the with them and he have access to more people and it 's more fun to uh play for a big ca uh uh a cost
1204,3,there 's a book i am really interesting in starting reading um it 's call out when hundred one masters of history it talks about all the hm the people in historic that made some mistakes like eight water um the russians one um it seems uh uh very interesting one and speaks about all uh a lot of history of other con is the most people that it 's not aware off so it seems to be uh really really good book
1205,3,the um the latest asks um that advisor meetings should no longer be required and the person writing the lead states that all the necessary information is already available on the website and also explains that it 's very often difficult to schedule meetings and to find a time where both the student and the advices are away devil um that 's the reason for suggesting or um proposing that advisor meetings should no longer be a requirement um the person um in the conversation says that he does n't agree to um that letter and that suggestion because he feels that advices off uh additional information that is not available on the website he also states that usually when you 're early enough you should n't have any problem scheduling i'm meeting
1206,3,i do n't like him is an like very much so like to talk but i am so thinking about reading eleven night is which is also very popular and d and i do to address down the invi something like bad de makes the topic and but yeah i'm very interested in reading books but pour yo d d d he 's
1207,3,and there is a book called one tells and famous places to visit i would really like to read this book because it states the most famous places and most valuable places to see uh i would like to pick up some of these places and go to visit them because i really first i really enjoy traveling especially with friends and secondly i really like taking pictures so that when to trip is over i can look at uh the pictures an would like live this moment again and that 's why i re freely would like to read this book called one tells and famous places the that 's it
1208,3,uh i personally prefer carrying a cell phone uh cell or mobile phone with me at all times because it 's there is is mean communications and really helps in a reading times were so one is an an emergency uh needs a help from uh someone also or the impor these it although ups uh because uh most modern phones uh help uh utilities that could be very beneficial to the person carrying cell or mobile phone uh such as uh note taking and uh and music playing such features that could help the modern person uh you have um center this the experience
1209,3,my friend ever introduce me a book called the education of love and she said it is very book good book for me and i would really want to read it and she introduce talk by providing the they um the the general information that the book describe a boy uh ap uh the boys life and in it and it happens many stories about love about the love between the parents in children between friends and between even the strangers i want to read this book because i want to learn how to of of an own to be kind an want to be pop for to helpful to others and so um this must be and interesting book
1210,3,the invention of mile phone is very controversial one because in one side there are people who prefer not to whole them but on the other side it has become necessary in fact that you on one and i always keep it with me uh because of several reasons uh the first one is that actually to this was become actually busy and it is impossible to travel around about a mobile phone not in order to uh take uh dates uh or or also to write the uh the uh organization of they as energ and uh and of course a on keeping contact the book for for emergency questions uh but also uh for uh important cause the which until both business and on the other side also uh leisure in fact killing friends for phone it 's possible the fact
1211,3,the writer of the letter playing and it is not reasonable to straight there 's to meet advisors from the start of the semester however the man from the conversation does n't agree with the writers opinion first of all he says that and even websites include some place information advisors actually give more helps um he gave an example of and uh advisors giving different ke and getting the information about the different classes and in in order to um graduate all some students and since they have more experience um they can give more help they websites also secondly he says that the problem of um not having the uh problem of making uh appointment is because some people some she as well until the last day and if they call office a only enough they can always make appointments when when they want
1212,3,i pre pref i prefer to uh have my mobile phone with me at all times that 's because if i had a mobile phone i can i would be able to communicate in uh ins time the library in emergence ch uh times emergency with my family such as new purse quake or if i am if i'm going to be late for uh import mean i can contact my uh my friend whether person going to meet intell than one help for have on or why i'm going to be late i do n't do so i might re use more reputation and i think it 's very crucial that you are able to communicate at all times that 's why i think i should have my mobile phone
1213,3,recently i have heard about uh then edition of books by a elec center ma course me uh which are all dedicate it to the same topic the first one is called my pro number one detective agents he lady detective agents it and i have heard a lot of ex somethings about the book first of all i am interested in in hearing um learning about how and outsider views the puts on a society and i am also very interested in the development of female characters in contemporary really literature so for all of those reasons uh i am
1214,3,uh consumers buy product they no not only um they also they also buy the container of the product with the product so the container is really important uh the key the container can be the appealing li by uh being user friendly for example ketchup or mustard uh bottles were made of class for uh so they had this is the customers at is the school of the lead and either or school or screw up but the plastic container was more convenient and also we can have a pleasing appearance appearance for example cookies they can come in a metal box instead of a cardboard box and decorate it so when people present it it guests it a look more nice cost second appealing so therefore there are two ways of making a container more appealing it can be user friendly or it can of a pleasing appearance
1215,3,the lecture wra first consumers and how the bird products also because of the container and that 's why it 's so important a design that 's why they lecture establish is two ways that a product container can be designed to appeal the consumers one is that he has to be as friendly as possible to the consumer for example if if you have the plastic for commitments like ketchup it 's better than the ones that was before that was of glass that it was really in convenient because you need spoons an other stuff so as to take it out but now it 's flexible and more practical it 's faster and easier to use it the other way is to give the container a pleasing appearance as this she gives the example of cookies if you put them in a box that is of metal and it 's really nice and it 's decorated guests you can you to guest and it will look classy
1216,3,i'm interested in reading the book name the secret uh because that book and ins and developed positive it a new and it 's about does is about a rock attraction have be at liked d or the do only the thing to the to herself and uh it will definitely do n't really helpful to change d to do the cd life i can see my life more positive a by reading the book so because of the reasons i'm are very major interested in reading basically d d d
1217,3,the two ways that a pro products container can be designed to appeal to consumers are user friendliness and pleasing appearance as user friendliness for example in the past ketchup or spain in a glass container which is difficult to screw of the lead and uh uh takes much time to pour and to the food but after the plastic containers her uh uh used to talk uh so the ketchup is more flexible and it 's more convenient to be really teaches excreta and also it 's much more faster and easier the second way is pleasing a parents examples that if a cookie manufacturer displace ourselves the cookies using a cardboard box it might not be much appealing usually but if he uses a metal walks by using some pictures on it some kind then it will be very classy and they could look very pleasing when the container is present to guests and that way it is usually appealing d d d d
1218,3,well the male student decision totally disagrees with what is stay teaching in in the letter regarding uh the regarding this and this is did to schedule meetings with academic advisors uh basically he goes years that uh whenever eys select a course or class the basic information is found in the website but that is not enough you need to to talk with someone else uh in this case a an academic advisor that will open you to yeah open your arise two different variety of options uh alway provide you with extra information uh besides he consumers that um this a schedule uh meeting with their timing advisors will not be uh will not created difficulty to uh have or to risk to to have schedules to have uh an another main is with other mc advisors because basically uh those who have problems with uh meetings with the with their academic advisors is because they they need to the last minute
1219,3,well i would personally prefer at reading a film indeed in our society people are stressed all the time no always afraid of missing a cool or that being there are two on circle which is actually a new te yearly before yet gray tire in such as a poem not or hit lower but now with the film own suffer that reason i think it 's but the freedom that that a thing film is a way of uh forming ones freedom and in the plants in the world do n't can call you unless you want to and in this problem we we have to some exapta film maybe during it of sometimes also privacy and well during wants time in d
1220,3,there are two main ways in which are products container can be designed to appeal to consumers the first one would be to be user friendly uh and which case it has to be as name says user friendly in the case of the ketchup bottle it 's to making it will plasti rather than uh class was to squeeze out the ketchup in very precise could it is rather than just taking the litt often taking or sp rude or just school she need on um the other ways the appearance you do not consumers do not want to show off playing thbe carton box of cookies only with the something pretty they connect the shop to guest or they can displayed has does it at situation um for cookies wants again a metal box pretty pictures or traditional pictures i thin related the cookies is a good move because people be proud of present in them to guests
1221,3,i 'd read the book check uh by cheap and a lot that is by point someone and i'm really interested to read this book specially because of the movie which is recently come that the street it yet it is based uh partially based on the movie uh plastic partially based on the book of chicken but that that the street it so the movie really allows my interest to read that book and to read how such students uh food of go for practical knowledge and not for to radical knowledge are uh not given importance in colleges and uh also the be at the flow was and the uh the way of teaching which is generally been used in injure in colleges m me by selves for is an engineering student so i want to read this book
1222,3,the proposal in the letter was uh basically about uh making it not compared studying for the students to uh have uh we can hold connect the meeting envir big their uh advisor in order to uh decide and what courses they should be taken in terms of guidance and watch have a uh because they find enough information in the website but the students uh what the thing regarding uh the man was discussing regarding the film uh topic was stating is opinion in the li that uh even though there are some basic information available on the website but there is n't information in terms of take needed session wat would want to uh take and what not to do because uh there is always some additional help information about the with the advice of them is not very difficult to actually get uh uh appointment and get an appointment on the professor so are bad basically is point is that it should be uh it it is not a very big
1223,3,the two students are discussing a problem that the man has with his band and they has started a band i would like to play in the campus auditorium for the follow high auditorium is booked for every weekend for the sun and the only option is either to play on a wednesday night or to perform with another band uh saturday i would recommend that they perform with another band on saturday as even though they do not have much time to perform they will be tired giving a lo larger audi what the as and may have uh in greater response they will be able to test or band and seem like improvements they can make before before releasing all their songs the public this way they will be able to test their band as well as uh be able to improve
1224,3,as the woman was talking the uh they get think the containers and how they attract the consumers so the container design plays uh big role and appeasing uh consumers and she was talking about um uh to to to to approach uh the first one was about to make the container friendly uh uh convenient to use as much as possible uh the example uh she give uh was the plastic container uh uh as in the ketchup so that container as flexible plastic it was made of flexible plastic and it was attracting a lot of consumer specially want comes to the just squeezing the container and get what it 's better uh own uh the food what what and they other abroad uh she was talking what is the container that uh get some going to a pleasing to the consumers
1225,3,uh a book that i would like to read is car uh lot of the rings by tol kin i 've a lot about this book and i had reason watched the movies and i found a very interesting especially the fact that talking so many years ago could actually make up but different line which were each type of card to be be he had uh each catch a really of people yet the he had invented like for example uh was book the different language and the old ke s s book are different language and it 's amazing that someone that long ago could even make up a whole different language it 's the interesting that 's why i want to read this book
1226,3,i like to uh have a cell phone or mobile phone with me at all times because i have a big family and uh hm um i have a daughter who six years old and have my mom and they like therefore and their sick any also and it have cell phone with me at all times in order to uh to know what what they 're doing and if they have any problems uh also have to take care about my uh parents doctors appointments and uh all the problems they have so have to being contact whether doctors and uh uh what kind of fl uh hm let test they need or um when they 're medication is uh is to to pick up from the families in our these stuff suggest being curren with my family and uh that 's why i um i i prefer to have cell phone with me at all times
1227,3,the man is part of the and he plays are in a band and the problem is that uh they are ready to perform on a concert they want to ho helped uh the concert on the campus uh auditorium but the campus auditorium is already books for the uh next uh couple of weeks uh weekends actually and um do n't the change that they get is to perform on uh wednesday night but his worried that uh they manner get a big audience um during wednesday night the other option that he uh the the band has is to perform with another band uh next saturday because or friends and that the other band i mean um mit it 's uh me to than okay to have uh their band to perform uh the opening act and the but the problem here is that the another the perform as many songs i thing for me know choose the uh wednesday night option even though the audience will be smaller they have work so hard uh on the songs and that they should be able to perform uh uh all the songs that that they have created and all behalf is
1228,3,the proposal mentions that since the information about the lectures are available on the website there is no need for required meetings with the uh advisors have or he does n't agree with this because he thinks the university website only has the basic info however there will be other additional information that will be helpful for the students and also he said advisors has uh has taught them ca n't toy tell them like uh they about their choices and also he said on the contrary to what it said in the proposal it is these two uh may can peop appointment with the professor he said if you call them early enough for just stop but office early enough they can have time for for uh students to speak with them if they do n't live it to the last day thus he does n't agree with the letter
1229,3,the problem uh the student the conversation is that there is not know um uh stay uh time all time is booked for the uh this before summer for the campus uh auditorium so the one of the characters one has a band and had wants to take a concer a rock concert so he has two solution whether he he says on wednesday not night they do n't have enough well not as much audience as they would like or they play with another band on the weekend but they have uh not uh enough time to day all the song songs they have been preparing i would recommend to play with the other band on the will on the weekend because they will have bigger audience that would get them in they would could play next time on uh and have people coming
1230,3,the professor first about how the container the design of the containers to those that deciding factor thoughts should because um the sh two ways that the deciding factor first way is if it 's the if the container is user friendly the means of the shape is easier to easier use and she use the example of the ketchup and mustard how before it was uh glass containers that he had on screw and help now they make flexible ketchup uh first flexible ketchup mustard bottles made of plastic which which you can just squeeze the second factor is how appealing it it and she talked about the box of cookies and how um he do n't want to present a box a a cardboard box to a guests but uh if it 's an uh classy metal box it 's more appealing to the eye and to the user f
1231,3,um i will mar mark better to to have one all the time uh and uh it 's it 's not help the at would be danger some times especially when would people that these leave and they put the cell phone just writing side the the pro the side the had uh this wait that might be dangerous but i think i up prefer to handle uh very uh i do n't know maybe it 's uh it could help in emergency cases or maybe somebody will need with so bad uh the time that uh it 's impossible to reach me without the cell phone and also family and friends and stuff like that it 's it 's it 's important have so the
1232,3,i prefer to have my mobile phone all the time with me because i want to be of able available for my family all the time and i want to call them if i have an accident as well there are games on my mobile phone and the internet i can use so it 's kind of um entertainment some for me it 's kind of uh for my security because when i'm in if i need help by can call anyone goo helps me out of the situation uh yeah me uh family cools can also always know where and then um they do n't have to the uh th they ke it
1233,3,well the proposal in the lead was to cancel the student counselor meet as it 's been organizing to ow the student says that it is difficult to schedule meetings because of the tied time limit and also the difficult thing arranging the same time when both the student and the counselor of free she says the basic information is always available on the net and so we do not need the student counsel me however the person does not agree with the what the letter in the proposal he says the wo the basic information is available in the net the advisors provide it with a lot more then that he says that the advisor ca n't uh let you know about the different kind of options which are available i like to choose them according to your potential he also says that the arranging a meeting should not be problem if you schedule the meeting when an advance he says that it becomes a problem only if you need things till the last minute
1234,3,the swarms basically s the let 's cli states that uh student to meeting with advisors and said they should be checking the website in techni requirement in tec new what you need a know what you have to do to for to graduate bec your classes and it and they see that it 's a waste of time to go and to as it 's white of uh organize meetings because they have to cha new see and when they are they and the man 's response to that responses and disagreements because he thinks it 's a bad its benefit to go to the because they need things more give view and they they use tree more options that he can help and because uh and because uh one p citizen clear and out and that he and that he is not face any problem with a planning meetings before since he he plants from before they advises other people not plan on last minute because there are a lot of the student want to meet with the concerts
1235,3,the design of the for the container um it 's an important factor f a cell success hm and and different ways how he can design a container to make very appealing um and appealing to the customer the first way um is to make it very user friendly as convenient as possible friends what the plastic container which is very and flexible um may can squeezing doubt um you can get out the content mean easy as opposed to glass containers used to be common beforehand way had to hm scoop out sings um two po something out and it could be a great last s let 's the first um um possibility of design second the possibility of designing um container to increase appealing as it 's um to make it look nice um so people would be fun of displaying at in the homes for instance a metal cookie box um with nice pictures on it so it looks classy and attractive
1236,3,um the proposal in the letter states that um it is in efficient um adapt meetings the advisor before the course on the um with semester starts hm unnecessary um because uh their information can receive their the website and also difficult to get uh get a meeting the personally um disagrees with this um she does n't see like that um because it 's not the same thing to have the uh to get information from the person as a receive information from the website um there 's always different ways to me the requirements from different classes and if you talk to somebody you can more it if you get a up them from within the website uh because they receive extra information and um it 's just easier to receive information about to choices the second reason why the person um disagrees with the proposal of the letter because it is always been easy to him to schedule meetings he 's never experience a problem um he just uh that it
1237,3,the man wrote a letter uh also s s for the uh mandatory meetings with advisors to be able to be s keep book cause he does n't see the point of uh come to speak with the person about something to read on the website and this man and uh which were on the take place from uh tries department fight some they uh experience that this advisor has and that they play a very important role in a uh an a being students to find a turning two ways to graduate and uh just helping people to do the report actions stuff and uh he does n't agree really with the letter and i can understand and one way that experie the people can sometimes clarify and give more information than others
1238,3,usually i always prefer to carry my cell phone with me all the time the man gives an is the uh that it helps me to arrange my schedule i hel uh iphone uh with internet facility which helps me to feet my scheduled related to meetings an appointment uh so uh i ca can get uh other time to time from my cell phone about these things secondly it helps me to get and emergency calls uh i'm working at the marketing manage ass and i get uh frequent cons from my support needs and superior experience and climb so there i if i having phone all the time with me helps me to attend such import
1239,3,the discussions between a boy girl the girl ot steve um who just found a the rock and roll band whether they will be a holding a concert with in the next time to for the summer break he says that um it would love to do in the auditorium you love to do it in the auditorium which is booked for uh the next weekends hence the own option they would have would be to play on a wednesday there uh catch is that the audience would be very small she also has the option to joining of the friend the band on saturday night which uh would make their time they have to perform limits it um i would recommend so i prefer the second possibility of the second choice because um he would have a high uh a bigger audience and he would definitely be able to show cases music to de fans of the other band as well and the whole environment might the little more friendly or might be might might be a better concert because um even if he has little time cannot show all songs you can show the best want
1240,3,the man does n't really agree with the the letter that he read mostly because uh he thinks that although you can find a lot of information on the internet about the uh new pick a sche an and everything he still thinks that uh advisor are unnecessary because they bring a lot of extra information about the curriculum that ca n't always always fine on the web and also he does n't agree with the the fact that uh the fact that the letter uh states that lot of uh schedule problem can arise but uh according to him then never had any problem and many because he thinks that should should take the time to to schedule an appointment in advance and never do with at the last minute then you wo n't have any problem like this and the shop problem than that 's because your done it at the last minute
1241,3,well the problem is that they could either play on wednesday and this way it be a a concert only for them but with a smaller audience and the the the other option would be to play in the weekend with the bigger band but this way they would play less time well i think that the hm the first option is the best because even though when you play with the bands a bigger band uh well known band um you mate you might may have the to a bigger chance to to to be reckon my spare other people i think it 's important to to have your own concert with your own audience even if it 's a small audience because this way you can um make sure that the audience really likes your music and no not really the music that the other bran explain and it 's more cause he i think
1242,3,uh while i was a child i was a book called the never ending story for mike and uh and um everybody uh uh in my class was uh pretty much uh um all all over the book in the really liked it and i was lie well are not uh reading very tells and so i uh i was never i never read it and um now when uh as an adult actually thinking that it will be nice to read it because it 's kind of uh part of a really nice history uh it 's of very trail book it has a lot of fancy in mystery and um i think uh woman something from not boring have n't um just get it again or get it an in read it and uh hm even if it 's a book for children
1243,3,the letter expresses the opinion that it 's not um necessary anymore to have a meeting with the advisor um in the beginning of each semester because the students opinion that all the basic information of the information can be find uh in the web and every student as ex has access to it and also he says that it 's really difficult to find time to meet with adver uh advisor and therefore it 's not uh necessary in water have it um just in the conversation the student says that he does not it reach that because he says that advisor has normally much more information than only the basic information provided by the web um he says that explai information it 's really important also help and to get an idea about different requirements for graduation and also he says that having problems to schedule meeting with the advisor is a problem of organization and not going there early time uh line because when you go early then you have a lot of hm possibilities above his bought what 's getting more difficult
1244,3,according to the reading epiphyte basically um some plants have their conta reading some plants have problems growing in getting getting to the sunlight so they are specific kinds called epiphytes which are unique because they adapt to life in they adapt the situation and they have different ways are surviving um then according to the conversation or the lecture uh there was basically the lecture give an example of an urn plant and in this he said that an urn plant wraps it 's basically wraps its roots around the tree and then he uses the tree in order to live it himself and with this support he can eventually reach the sunlight also it has um a very different kind of shape from other plants such that it can it can um collect water and it space and also this waters uh what is a by for forms a kind of a fertilizer
1245,3,um i would be really um interested in reading the bible um i i seem passages on the street solar people telling them or in a on advertisement better never really taking a time to read it and i would really like to because i think that it 's a book that explains why i most people in the word believe where we believe and i have heard that it 's a book the so is beautiful things about a humans and the earth and how everything has main and will be so i would i would really love treat the bible and perhaps i could learn something from
1246,3,epiphytes have adapted to life in the rain forest by attaching themselves to the the attaching the root around the trees um in hi in height so they can receive sunlight because sometimes the leaves are so um they has a lot of deaf s so on there 's a lot of sun the sunlight underground in very fans can brother but epiphytes of s um such as the urn plant have um have n't now attach to the trees and can get sunlight and because of their unique um shape of the leaves like a cone money rains the the draw ups fall rude only use until um till the bowl so the s or water and sometimes insects of other things go inside and they service fertilizers a nutrients for the plant
1247,3,uh the man learn from the letter was uh saying that they require the schedule meetings with advisors be uh dropped because all the information is available on the university website and also it 's usually d difficult time the time that tubes both the advisor and the student uh but the manner adver the article did n't agree his so but it was a big difference between just reading information on the websites and meeting advisor because the advisor can give extra uh um suggestions and has much more information to provide for each individual students that might fit that particular students uh also is about the schedules meetings with the schedule meeting was you should not a problem it 's just if you wait for the last minute then then it can be difficult to find time with the advisors bit he has himself not have a problem so he think which stay the same way
1248,3,the letter questions whether it is necessary to have advisor story meetings every semester to or um select which classes he want to take which is mandatory for at the moment and um well well the letter wants that to change in one 's that not to be instead any in stated anymore um the man disagrees with that he thinks that yes the basic information definitely are available on the website but it does n't give you the extra knowledge that advisor has the advisor knows all the different requirements an old different classes that you can take and he has lot of extra in first um also the letter states that another reason to not do does um meetings anymore is that all of the bec problems of the scheduling of the meetings but the man disagrees with that as well because he never had any problems and he basically is that somebody that because the last minutes will have problems because when you go early they will store be enough space in time in the schedules available
1249,3,well in the letter um informed to the student that the meetings with advisors are not necessary um at the beginning of the uh school year because all the information relate it is on the uh university website and this is one uh also to play space to have uh as the schedule a meeting with the advisor when the student really required it so um the studen a opinion is that they she does n't agree with the this letter he believes that they it 's important to have any way the meeting with advisor because advisor provides uh information that ease not in the website website has just they uh a limited meaning on information about the advisor can provide details of what they need
1250,3,i would like uh to read a book country rev fee which his going to to buy the indian author the minister roman happen actually this book it is very beautiful look i heard about it it contains the information about all of the states of the india and with the colorful my ups and the fig there 's and there 's also the population uh it 's mentioned about each state how the cultures out there and how to i mean how the people uh they are what of of of question they are uh mostly choosing again uh how is the cultural because states india this is because i cannot or the india because of my funs financial constraint so i would like to read this book so that i can get an idea moved india as a whole take you
1251,3,uh one to of the ways in which uh marketing to consumers can be made uh more appealing is by deciding the containers in different ways uh one of that would be deciding sit through go uh panels on the sides which shows uh large of the product as left an side and m by needing this pro uh containers re usable make them more appealing to consumers because they can put in other staff after they are than using the products and uh it would help them see how much of their of the product as left in the comers an another uh container designing method be using teams many of the products these stays advertise so mobile goals to appeal to uh spech it will be the younger kids they have all these animation to stay any waited carton stuff on them so that gets recognize carry trend because that product
1252,3,i like keep my cell phone with me at all times and the reason i rather go with the cell phone is because i like to be uh in touch with family and friends i like to be able to talk to them uh at any time and like them to like that they can reach me at any time to another reason that i like to keep my cell phone with me is because uh in case of emergencies because i have to children that uh little and i would like to know if anything comes up with them as soon as possible d d
1253,3,epiphytes have adapted to the life done the light from the rain forest d um using tall trees as support they sometimes can be as hires forty al thirty to forty meter meters high about the canopy in they do that just to get sunlight the other um characteristic of this plant is a shape of believes their shape workable where they 're going to store the water and also other nutrients that may for into them will decompose and develop into uh nitrogen rich water that can be stored in can be use asked needed by this point it therefore they can survive um such conditions d
1254,3,i do own a cell phone and i prefer to carry with me at all times the main reason i had a se but or cell phone in the first was was because you never no one uneasy my come up and that 's why i have my s of what we always like eyes that you can prepare from the reading sisters always pass to have the cell phone but there is a time in place for cell phones and i do think it 's really room people just without their cell phones maybe like the middle of dinner or something so cell phones are useful and i carry with mean hm all times because i never know when i will need it but i i do n't always just take uh my cell phone because i consider rude
1255,3,because epiphytes can grow pretty high up clearly they do n't have um access to the ground where they can plant roots and all they have a p there is work clear access to sunlight so what epiphytes like the urn plant have done is uh has done is that it 's leaves create a bowl and this is actually use to collect water so will there is a water but also plants need minerals an all the nutrients what it does is the ball also collects things like insects and dead leaves and they watch down with the water so than they decompose and as they so they decompose uh they 've like nitrogen is form and then this nitrogen goes into the water and the plant can use the well like you liquid fight nitrogen as fertilizer for food so that the plant has the sunlight water and nutrient pe
1256,3,in the lecture uh students um propose that the the stu s would not should n't be required to meet the academic advisor before the semester begins because it is the all the information uh about the class is um and swarm are rare available on the website uh and moreover students of an have diff difficult find difficult to me a schedule the appointment with the teacher that because we do n't have the time but um the boy um in the discussion does n't agree with the letter because uh if i'm defines that uh they in the website you can find the basic information but they are not enough and the advisor have a lot of extra information that he can give you um mo overly fine he if he thinks that uh freeze no trouble in scheduling an appointment with their fights if you schedule lead to in time and wait to the last day
1257,3,according the proposal of the attack the meeting that uh the students epi schedule with the academic advisor the for the join and every semester uh should be done way with the family because like mission write my such advisors is available on the university website and uh it 's mostly a waste of time besides the there is the there is difficulty in scheduling such meetings th the man does not agree with this opinion states that they uh websites provide the limited mission and uh other students and the other does n't opinions not an great is only with the their get make advisors one the one the sides if the uh they try to schedule a meeting with such advisors well in the branch there 's no trouble and uh the trouble arises only one student with the last possibility to schedule a meeting sides uh uh he says that website to
1258,3,according to the reading passage an epiphyte is is a species adapted to access sunlight by living on a host tree it has to has it has developed unusual mechanism to absorb nutrients and in the listening passage the professor talks about urn plants and gives it as an example of an epiphyte other urn plant wraps itself around the branch and use a tree to support itself and access the sunlight it had it has long stiff spiky leaves and as a as a funnel shape leaves uh which is shape breakable when rain falls it it it gathers and shaped and stores water so that it could be used also when insects and dead leaf all onto the live it gets watch doubt and break it 's side break it 's site de plant which provi s reach nitrogen by giving these this example the professor explains epiphyte
1259,3,uh the students uh the university were talking uh th uh the guy uh or the band in the conversation a student his starting a bad with his uh with this mate and he plays it or and they 've been practicing and they want to do their first concert uh they were planning to do the concert uh the next couple of weeks before summer before everybody goes home uh they wanted to do the auditorium because they play rock roll musics or to outs uh it 's going to sell like really greater but the problem is that uh the auditorium is is booked uh that period so they can uh uh uh there were two options they can uh either play uh wednesday night but the problem is that uh there was uh there 's going to be a small audience or they can play with another about this problem is that with that that uh they will have the about the after to play i think they should uh definitely play only as i think uh if they play alone and they will the shi more and then they will be popular more
1260,3,another like example of uh appealing the consumer buy their the container is the material used to make the container like fast second there is are more appealing then um in class for because is much easier it uses more from device it 's example that as ketchup container she 's to being class which is hard to get uh but when now it 's in plastic is just needs those reason as a guy and other other other were uh example that is displaying cookies is to be a carton box which is not very appearance is only displaces his house or any presents for guest another putting in metal box with decoration all that also it 's much more feeling when put pleasing on they were anything and it 's also much of filling when uh like giving a as a gift or personally to guest when first or
1261,3,one book that i uh like to read is the letters get without it uh because i 've heard their that it 's very funny and uh it 's also uh um he in the in the water has to do the fun a way of uh talking about different characters and what could happened uh would life 's and maybe in the in the future or uh if we were go out to space or something um and uh and it 's also uh discussing questions that are really more move that people think about and he will answer summon a fun where party so that something that i would uh would try to read
1262,3,even the weather real uh actually has my have my cell phone on me all the time uh but i think it 's uh some kind of the security that i have uh ch always be uh able to a call someone a want or um maybe for other people to contact me whenever they want to will need to uh though i think it 's it 's quite bad for the social life uh th always bring and with you sometimes use u actual will need break from it and so would high uh but i think it 's it 's it 's a behavior that of e that i have uh but i have learnt uh since first time that i uh used it so and so used it that i can really be with and more
1263,3,in the past i was one of those awful who would not bring their cell phones with them anywhere i just use it for making phone calls and uh i did n't have that much new at all times this days however or um have my cell phones with me everywhere i go besides this task sort of course um my new cell phone has all the features for maps to you uh suggestions and all into think features so um to give me an answer store questions or my have uh a time um i can plan my movie visit to uh hm book uh trap or maybe even make a reservation directions so i 'd you have a good me all times to distance
1264,3,d well this letter proposes that um meetings between students advisors are no longer required and now water this letter states that uh basically uh old information is available on the university website and uh um there is no need to meet their person to deco this information was um they might be a problem with scheduling those equipments uh the man uh disagrees with this opinion and uh they are the reason for this disagreement is the fact that not just not old information is available in the website and uh hm people actual have extra information and expertise to make it easier for us to select the right courses and double which argues that uh scheduling is not a problem or have to do use to uh try to schedule the appointment on time and not wait till the girl as they uh
1265,3,um i prefer to have my cell phone with me all time for two reasons uh firstly i'm very social persons so i have a lot of people to contact with um i have a lot of friends and um i have a lot of people i know and i know that they want to contact me any time and i want to contact many time to so um if i do n't have my cell phone with me that would be very hm very uncomfortable and secondly i i whenever business on my of my own it 's on line book in our ins called shop and um to do that i have to contact comic customers and for that reason um it would be a lot better to keep my cell phone with me all that
1266,3,there are many people which do not bring the mobile phone with them everywhere they go or which do n't have the mobile phone i old i prefer i personally prefer to have my mobile phone with me all the time and this is uh because of several reasons on the one hand i do n't have uh regular phone at home so i have my mobile with me at all times so if there is an emergency that uh i'm available all the times so that my semi can reach me everywhere where i am and uh get reason it support work as it is very important uh these days that you that queue uh are available and ants immerse quickly it is uh good to have your mobile with you all the time and so that he can need everybody if it 's necessary
1267,3,uh i have not with the the guy trans or by calm to shinny and it seems second pretty interesting book because j uh what i read the summary about the book in the lag the get shows that book is about uh two best friends and how their french or goods over time and then how their french of also breaks or rese time um the cover seems really interesting as uh has a cover of uh f can is th and then the situation during their or when they will consider in their frie i think i would like to read the book to guide to enter
1268,3,i like to have my cell phone or mobile phone with me all at all times for two reasons first um there might be an emergency case i had a car accident few years ago and at i had my cell phone with me at the time so i could contact my parents that my friends for help it is a really they can off and secondly with with these days we can use other device is his cell phone we can you you can frozen internet or text message with my friends so i can be connected all the time or i can be updated all the time whenever i need it for those reasons i prefer to have cell phone with me at all times
1269,3,i think parents should be involved in children 's decision to some point because uh i think i 'll be helpful for children to have uh familiar person giving them advice about the university and their future um i think parents could give adequate advice to the children because they know the cho and they know the top very well since pers and tell is very familiar them obviously d and i think that parents can give them good guidance and they can read the way to uh more successful future but the children should have a lot more freedom from parents
1270,3,um the concept her goo of swarm intelligence means that uh one in the way they are do some simple action to you know uh accomplish a task uh a come complex task and the ants they just one they have to go for the for source and if they need obstacles like to trees and uh the really have a long way to go and just one ca n't uh accomplish that and uh you know the first money can just uh how the end of the branch and uh uses bass like and the per his a body forward to the open space and the next one just uses lect are uh the used his like to hold of the head and do the same position and one after one the just can keep still to hold the position and they just form a bridge so the rest of the ants they can just in or go across the bridge and i finally they will get to the the branch where the food is located then they get the food source this is the case
1271,3,as far as i'm concerned the agree that parents should be involved in the process of helping the children to choose a university first of all um they e experience this before so i believe that there are more adapt ad guiding ass um since they experience they would know what procedures or or starts we should take in order to reach the ideal university also uh they know about their child the best um since they know about their child uh this means that they will also know the special areas where their children are interested or are timed because of these reasons parents should be involved in the process of helping helping their children to choose a university
1272,3,a swarm intelligence uh as of uh phenomenal uh which is common among uh insects well in ins it starts uh doing something and then the others do the same thing uh then they can accomplish in the tree f things the would n't uh look they could n't have achieve otherwise they can a tree complex talks uh complex tasks and he would be example of uh the ants which is second here um well colony is move together to to go to the food sources and when there is an obstacle for example tree um what is a wide space between uh first branches and the second branch this si uh know ants can get from one branch to the other branch about all by itself so the first ants hold stu the first uh branch then it 's structures uh i thing the opens by s and then the second uh on s comes and stretches does the something actually and then it forms a bridge and uh the ants can get to the to get the food
1273,3,i think teenager teenage is a generally a very difficult period in any persons life because uh this is a time when a person uh starts growing up and feel like an adult and wants to do everything by himself have his own opinion and uh act independently of their parents and most of the time when uh parents are the people who uh who bring this up and they are used to have an as it 's children always direct us and teachers what to do and how and they and during teenager um teenage time they always many difficult when their children tend to acting depended pur from them so they do cause a lot of problems their pair
1274,3,on one side company can save money by reducing operating costs like for example the coffee shop in time who change all their light bulbs who are which were regular light bulbs to light bulbs who last longer and use less energy uh also um if a company becomes envir more environmentally friendly they can attract uh student type of consumer who is very where of the fact that it is important to protect the environment so if they will become attracted by the company because they are using environmental friendly practices then they will be more inclined to spend more money at that company like for example the coffee shop who use study using recycled paper for their cups and the napkins and then the smartly start using that facts into the uh advertisement so people who are in fall ph with the environment were more attractive to the coffee shop
1275,3,parents top or bird that use the usually uses it 's wings to fly usually when hunts for well when hunts refers uh the sun reflects the the sun is reflected in the water and it comes back to kept it i so i ca n't really see properly any ca n't see the fish so it started to use its wings as an umbrella to cover the sun it would turn it turn it 's back to the sun and put its wings over over it had it cover the sun and it gives a shade and it makes it makes it easier for the bird to see the fish and be able to get them this is this is how the heron uses uh this is how the heron uses exaptation because it 's using its wings not only to fly but also cover the sun and uh be able to see the fish
1276,3,the university plan is to change uh usual books to the electronical devices which will help student to uh use the information uh about it there uh student the read who read the article uh does n't uh agree with the plan uh she has a uh many reasons for that first of all the electronic device can break down so uh it they will need to students only money to uh to hm six it the second thing it 's that uh they are fancy features are be entering uh so uh students will uh want uh been want to borrow latest version of the device uh the sort think is that uh it 's really hard to use for those uh persons who have normal size finger cause they are to see the devices are too small and uh the lasting uh that the girl likes uh old fashion style d uh studying when she uh need to do it with the band in a paper
1277,3,the problem that the professors are discussing has is that the female english professor has a scheduling conflict she has a poetry class at four o'clock the next day which is a review review session for a take that the student a next we can is very important however the at the same time she also has a cousin 's retirement party which is also at four o'clock are the two solutions from the conversation i would recommend the second one with states that uh which would be in that the professor uh teachers at four o'clock an arise and the party read uh that will be the solution because sent state meaning as they made in uh in this professor is not show office give abilities to uh teach poetry since he has n't taught that into years he 's a bit rusty and he might not be able to handle the class very effective be however there she uh takes the class an arise daily to can have the best to book point
1278,3,the two professors are discussing a scheduling conflict that the lady professor has with her poetry class at four o'clock the next day she has to choose it mean re reading an exam review for a poetry class students which starts four o'clock and attending her cousin 's retirement party which also starts at four o'clock the two solutions uh from the conversation where that she should attend the retirement party and have the other professor film for her class and be the exam review or lead her students to the exam review her solve prepare them for the test and then go late to her cousin 's party i would recommend that she litt exam review for her students in order to better prepare them for the exam and then go late to her cousin 's party bridges more of a priority for her because she is professor and her students depend on her it will be better for her students if she let the exam review then a professor who have in talk point boy
1279,3,ancient roman cities extended me grow large find men t because of two developments first was romans developed advance building materials strictly types of concrete which harden under water with which they build bridges and these bridges were able to move carts and other bag ins with materials on them to different locations and they also develop the second more important development was the improve the way to move fresh water from far off locations fly given higher ap in the mountains to the cities and this water uh was channel lie stu aqueducts which are specialize channels and this help people maintain um of started living by having clean and fresh water to be it and drink so they did not live near water sources so this help roman cities grew very large because people could live away from water sources and river banks and get function normally
1280,3,the problem the professors are discussing that one of the professors has got a scheduling conflict t needs to teach a class at four o'clock the next day but she also wants to visit the cousin 's retirement um party at four talk the next day so the other professor says he could help his free at four he could eat um cover the class um but then the other professor says um that she might um do the review session and comes late to the retirement party i would prefer that she um to um teaches her class and comes late to the retirement of her cousin because it 's her work and it 's more important that she goes to work on visiting um her her custom because in a class their most students who are dependent on the class to the test and it 's more important there well prepared for the test and even if she comes late to her cousin 's retirement she is the visiting him an up this part of the family
1281,3,the pro professor is a problem inter agenda there are two uh similar uh or there are two events planned at the same time at four o'clock a poetry class and uh there is other cousin 's retirement party and uh well in my opinion she 's go to the class because were students make college funs and so they have a right to good uh recommend uh yeah education and uh her colleague ke uh presented an option for him to take over her class but he does not the expansion experience she has so in that way the level of educations should be or would be uh uh lowered so in my opinion she should go to the class come late to the cousin 's retirement party because uh well in in this case you 'll to your students uh in my
1282,3,i do not admire could n't t notes um directing work because uh i think is movie in general pre korean s a lot of violence but also the pla the she 's liquid on inspired and it seems like he has some kind of sick this are um to work five and so basically he is movie seeing quite cell ph in the old intern and older just not surprising at all um um lately he is just been using is his name to like it 's name to uh is explore the dis fame make he even worse movies um with even less of uh a good plot so yeah now it much from
1283,3,i personally do not like that it up uh because i think he is an over ready actor uh in besides are really understand what his movies about although it is supposed to be artistic can intellectual by uh that is think that he is a very over it actor and eat eat it he gets a lot of clear um more than he what he dessert uh average i rese the reason movie there are after listening only moving actually wash were shock a lot and besides that i did not their what it was saying attend the movie was pointless uh although it is a high claim the movie but i have my own opinions and for other people would um highly uh disagree with me but i guess that 's what uh personal opinion is about an freedoms speech so yeah i do n't really lecture need
1284,3,uh the universities they changing it to say electronic text box uh this could be happen by purchasing to reading device with in which um text box get a could be downloaded and great insist about the woman think that uh this uh idea is not but for uh first of all the cost uh actually uh uh cheaper comparing to uh textbooks but uh this will not be uh effective uh the cost will be higher when this device is broken or the person need to at the second reason is uh i key is is very small and this is is uh very inconvenient to the for the student to you with it they keep that the small and the highlighting ke uh and very how to to highlight or to manage a feature and the woman also likes old fashion way of studying
1285,3,i think that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university um must specifically i'm going to their passes size and i think it 's very helpful to have my parents there because you know it is actually get going to be team for no the support me in whatever i do life ri go it 's film pour in that i have there can said that if they also agree with the choice university um in addition i think it 's important has parents give their children that that they are experience um because they entered for an a no h how absent down of going through this process a selection um the also just because it 's important have connection with your family and have this for you
1286,3,there are some type of assignments that the students are asked to do in school um barriers the research paper class presentation or group project many talk but the class presentation which i think it 's one of the most useful ways to for students who learn my think it 's it 's really beneficial because the students are are meant to choose to research and to to find the answers for the statement then they are cannot sure that information to the rest of the student so many of the students or the rest of the class is going to be able to to learn about what that presentation what 's but so that 's why i think that 's really useful way to to to
1287,3,the pr a was assigned in academic assign i would do it in a group project the speakers make student could project um allowing to do all the people my group me to do is um gather information and just organize a mark together and the s present a project and because a lot of people are in the group it is easier and it is so much more convenient than doing alone as alone i would have to do it all by myself and will take a lot of time however when where a group we can or divide individual parts for what um one person as to do and that is so much easier and convenient this is why i choose to reading good projects
1288,3,according to the letter uh student wants practice room to be oft on time at night roman occur uh clearly agrees with the students idea portion mentions that she does n't have the they ad dorm anymore uh until now and she used to play at her dorm room since the is it will was o o on them at night she felt very sorry for the students were sleeping or study even though she um she played a is a lot acquire live whether were she thinks this is a good idea since she he can real she carries uh with uh she can make whether way should n't to eight practiced or much easier people are that but they were they cost a people made why people already may reservations to practice rule which wait which enable urn to reserve the room
1289,3,the two ways where d the lakes can disappear of our uh at a characterized as in a true way or away which his done by humans the natural way involves um um many generations of plants which by in the sea by dying in the sea t plan to solve some to mit substance which then um falls on to the bottom for lake if this processed is reputed really is repeated for many years the bottom and this money substance increases and the bottle fields up therefore the water is press out of two lake and therefore that late disappear s the second way is by how humans sp especially farmer s use the water to every get their crops but not but this this regard the replace on of the water which cannot find which is not enough
1290,3,the advertising technical free feet persuade consists of uh stating out the disadvantages of a project and then which filling it buyed say in water are the products advantages and how the overcome the a disadvantages uh the example of the television publicity well uh that sells pants import it 's that the woman in the publicity says they the spends are very sh very expensive however the actor courses worldwide because the depends have a life long borrowing th e that means that you 'll be it 's saving money instead of spending a lot of money in a good product so the the the
1291,3,the author were state that uh gives the music building open later if usually just close at night pm and the author think he should open onto midnight firstly studen likes to play mu instrument later and night and a lot of people are using the rooms and there is not enough room for enough people to tra uh practice the instrument the lady was the lady think it 's a great idea for the music student because they always do n't have the rooms and the time periods not right that so she has to practice in form and why other people is trying to sleep and she think it 's not good to disturb other people and interrupt their sleeping time secondly there is a lot of people needs to spend more time before the concert uh but every time she try to practice there 's no room so she support that music building open later in a good idea
1292,3,i think i would like to go with an option called the gro group project because in the search people you have to go outside and do the work but it would not include academic what only practical 's works should be do n't only secondly class presentation would include the lecturers lectures uh presentation and which lecture would spee can you cannot uh uh you cannot ask questions button group project project you can ask questions to each other you can jane knowledge with each other and not uh he that you can uh uh increase another spi in directing with other people as well group project is having certain ad one that is that uh food uh in this new or knowledge by other people as well and it 's uh important to her could not
1293,3,the man 's problem is that he is going to write an article be other school play and one that is fir uh want to interview the director of this plain but unfortunately distract is having about cold and so he could i 'd ways but then the article works choose th she will get printed into the newspaper after the play has take place were could individual actor but this one is act would not provide a spech information well i would probably decides to wait because the quality of the newspapers more important than the actual time with his when it is writing and what he could do is to not only write about play but also give face on personal statements on the quality of the play was it good persons bad and so he could just connect the stu things
1294,3,according to the letter the writer is not recommending the us the in trees in the range of available time in the miss building due to the needing of music students and to increase the number of reservations also accord to the conversation the woman agrees with this idea in the letter by giving additional support accord to the woman uh uh these woman is a music student who has once experience that her practices in the dorm rooms ca n't interfere with the neighbors daily will teen furthermore it co uh is hard to get and reservation in the co before right before the concert because all the members at orchestra should practice in the practice rooms so by this new policy it could increase the availability uh practice friends in the music probably
1295,3,um it 's better of course the studying places where they are are uh of few people are no peoples since they are generally and there 's more shy w silence um they are less crowded so you are able to concentrate better to if you have to read a right um when they are a lot of people around it is much more difficult to be able to write or read whatever you have to in order to accomplish uh homework or to a brand exam um generally people have a hard time concentrating and that 's my case i cannot concentrate when i'm in the middle of a cry or plan uh i i can pay attention to conversation
1296,3,the problem speakers are discussing is um that i girls waiting for friend to go to the movies she has watch a movie for college and uh she her frien is really late and does n't answer her her phone calls or um does n't answer her text messe is uh so she has to decide if she can she reduce with our friend or if she wait for her with better and um gets that lake and uh i agree um with george because i think that if she has want to movie um and she ca n't go the next day she 's with the car and if she 's ants she 's called her and he has n't answer it is already fitting intelli uh i think the best i there would be to leave for its male and um and then go alone and her friend in meeting go the next day
1297,3,i believes that uh the degree to watch a top might be rewarding depends on the impact but he have was a trouble people on the environment and maybe the word in general i think they um impact can be matter throw to hm matches which would be the mount of people that can be reach the head and how the to impression is in my point of view the best way uh most rewarding job good busy newspa pictures illus because they can reach a lot of people can bring get topic for uh for what quite a lot also university professor and then environment assigned his ca n't get to the where they can live in impression make an impact but for me the newspaper journalist would have the products rains to do so and the bills possibility
1298,3,the speaker to can to bus than an at for shopping her tour flight was the lay so she should should early head and it 's lead and her problem is she is going to have a history paper stay interest about an hour but she 's not really prepare because student any chance to and there are two solutions she can as a possible her presentation for the next day and ask the professor to late or she could drink some cups of coffee and make it well i would suggest first solution because the presentation is made me only for the class as as they can ask questions learn more about subject well if she 's not while prepare she want deliver information official which would kind damage the learning process so i think it would be a good idea to talk to a professor and change the presentation days that her classmates can take most advantage from her presentation and she wants feel that anxious that she 's shorten time official should be able to cope with other some city
1299,3,for me the best place to him if somewhere which is caused the center so that it can because everything the well cause you school most to the place that you live uh that you world and cost grass restore and for me during my experience i used to leave and uh play which will which was far away from the center so whenever i needed to to to go to grass restore had to take the bus or the may trial cla it was very inconvenient so i would advisor to come to the call to my neighbor heard which is very died s very call close to every they can able really enjoy
1300,3,uh i would like to be a university professor as uh uh i would like to be university professor and that would be make career choice that they would think is most wording uh the reason for this uh the reason for this it would be may need the student contraction that i would have uh uh as a university professor where an and tackle a lot of students an and be able to um men taught them and uh help them decide and if futures a second the how the research uh and exploring that i would be able to do uh ten you really uh as in my feel study uh will be very rewarding uh ena light be able to be back a lot to the society and that i think his
1301,3,in the conversation the two students discuss the problem of the girl who has wants a good see movie to for fall i'm as an assignment from the movie class she suppose the watch a movie to be able to discuss it an class next week she 's wing for friend while who is fifteen minutes light different does n't answer a calls and we if the girl that leaves soon she will miss the beginning of the movie so the other student suggest the solution that she which is go by herself that her friend could see the movie later but the girl has that the she the girl said she would be the friends that she would be busy and might be late on the other and she 's often like so the girl which is live uh boys now i go see the movie by herself if she would wait a lot would long as she would miss looking of the movie i would just live friend was not in go watch the movie to for for the assignment
1302,3,i would advice my friend to move in the save neighbor had he likes to go out during the night and it 's better to live in a save neighbor hurt so that he can avoid the dangerous of uh be inc uh uh outside the house during the night another important thing about the neighbors it if that it should uh uh have but the transportation available and also that uh and there are many um interesting ke uh uh coffee shop s where he ca n't spend uh she 's free time and may be libraries and musing
1303,3,um the proposal is about that um the construction transition the man 's for uh holidays or some are breaks when there is no school uh the point is that uh during school uh people have to arrive in time and when the construction pushes the um the streets would want or something it 's uh more so it ca n't arrive of time learn the places to pour the courses walk plasti to take to want to be completed because of the bad very conditions such as rain ants know during the winter and the best uh time for this construction projects or uh during is during the summer uh when there is no not love people are uh they grow uh greece um because she choice a car and she 's usually to class um and she is a low it by that and uh in the professors lead their know it so that 's why uh she total agree is when point propose
1304,3,a very good place to lives uh with a daily community way the in the save neighbor rude and uh it has partying lot like a practi party love for the rest did n't and then several uh sell from uh a several features like so main people and fina center and tennis call or and then now with the this an prize compared to the minimum which uh d that is compared to the people that live in the town and it with a lot of trees they care but the environment and with the make it make the air cooler clothes so the apartment
